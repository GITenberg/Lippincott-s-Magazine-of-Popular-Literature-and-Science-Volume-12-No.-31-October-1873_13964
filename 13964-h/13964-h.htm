  <p>Behold me, then, with five hours around my neck, like so many
  millstones, in Strasburg, on the abjured Rhine! Had I not vowed never
  to visit that bewitched current again? Was it not by Rhine-bank that
  I learned to quote the minnesingers and to unctuate my hair? From her
  owl-tower did not old Frau Himmelauen use to observe me, my cane, and
  my curls, and my gloves? Did not her gossips compare me to Wilhelm
  Meister? And so, when he thought he was ripe, the innocent Paul
  Flemming must needs proceed to pour his curls, his songs and his love
  into the lap of Mary Ashburton; and the discreet siren responded,
  &quot;You had better go back to Heidelberg and grow: you are not the
  Magician.&quot;</p>

  <p>Yet before that little disaster of my calf period I sighed for the
  Rhine: I used its wines more freely than was perhaps good for me, and
  when the smoke-colored goblet was empty would declare that if I were
  a German I should be proud of the grape-wreathed river too. At Bingen
  I once sat up to behold the bold outline of the banks crested with
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 370]</span> ruins, which in the morning
  proved to be a slated roof and chimneys. And when at Heidelberg I saw
  the Neckar open upon the broad Rhine plain like the mouth of a
  trumpet, I felt inspired, and built every evening on my table a
  perfect cathedral of slim, spire-shaped bottles&#8212;sunny pinnacles
  of Johannisberger.</p>

  <p>And now, decoyed to the Rhine by a puerile conspiracy, how could I
  best get the small change for my five hours?</p><a name="image-0002"

  <p>Should I sulk like a bear in the parlor of the Maison Rouge until
  the departure of the Paris train, or should I explore the city? Some
  wave from my fond, foolish past flowed over me and filled me with
  desire. I felt that I loved the Rhine and the Rhine cities once more.
  And where could I better retie myself to those old pilgrim habits
  than in this citadel of heroism, a place sanctified by recent woes, a
  city proved by its endurance through a siege which even that of Paris
  hardly surpassed? One draught, then, from the epic Rhine! To-morrow,
  at Marly, I could laugh over it all with Hohenfels.</p>

  <p>The Münster was before me&#8212;the highest tower in Europe, if we
  except the hideous cast-iron abortion at Rouen. I recollected that in
  my younger days I had been defrauded of my fair share of
  tower-climbing. Hohenfels had a saying that most travelers are a sort
  of children, who need to touch all they see, and who will climb to
  every broken tooth of a castle they find on their way, getting a
  tiresome ascent and hot sunshine for their pains. &quot;I trust we
  are wiser,&quot; he would observe, so unanswerably that I passed with
  him up the Rhine quite, as I may express it, on the ground floor.</p>

  <p>I marched to the cathedral, determined to ascend, and when I saw
  the look of it changed my mind.</p>

  <p>The sacristan, in fact, advised me not to go up after he had taken
  my fee and obtained a view of my proportions over the tube of his
  key, which he pretended to whistle into. We sat down together as I
  recovered my breath, after which I wandered through the nave with my
  guide, admiring the statue of the original architect, who stands
  looking at the interior&#8212;a kind of Wren
  &quot;circumspecting&quot; his own monument. At high noon the twelve
  apostles come out from the famous horologe and take up their march,
  and chanticleer, on one of the summits of the clock-case, opens his
  brazen throat and crows loud enough to fill the farthest recesses of
  the church with his harsh alarum.</p>

  <p>A portly citizen was talking to the sacristan. &quot;I hear many
  objections to that bird, sir,&quot; he remarked to me, &quot;from
  fastidious tourists: one thinks that a peacock, spreading its jewels
  by mechanism, would have a richer effect. Another says that a swan,
  perpetually wrestling with its dying song, would be more poetical.
  Others, in the light of late events, would prefer a
  phoenix.&quot;</p>

  <p>The dress of the stout citizen announced a sedentary man rather
  than a cosmopolitan. He had a shirt-front much hardened with starch;
  a white waistcoat, like an alabaster carving, which pushed his shirt
  away up round his ears; and <span class="pagenum">[pg 371]</span> a
  superb bluebottle-colored coat, with metal buttons. It was the
  costume of a stay-at-home, and I learned afterward that he was a
  local professor of geography and political science&#8212;the first by
  day, the last at night only in beer-gardens and places of
  resort.</p><a name="image-0003" id="image-0003"><!--IMG--></a>

  <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; I said, &quot;the barnyard bird is of all others
  the fittest for a timepiece: he chants the hours for the whole
  country-side, and an old master of English song has called him
  Nature&#39;s &#39;crested clock.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;With all deference,&quot; said the bourgeois, &quot;I would
  still have a substitute provided for yonder cock. I would set up the
  Strasburg goose. Is he not our emblem, and is not our commerce
  swollen by the inflation of the <i>foie gras</i>? In one compartment
  I would show him fed with sulphur-water to increase his biliary
  secretion; another might represent his cage, so narrow that the
  pampered creature cannot even turn round on his stomach for exercise;
  another division might be anatomical, and present the martyr opening
  his breast, like some tortured saint, to display his liver, enlarged
  to the weight of three pounds; while the apex might be occupied by
  the glorified, gander in person, extending his neck and commenting on
  the sins of the Strasburg pastry-cooks with a cutting and sardonic
  hiss.&quot;</p>

  <p>You have not forgotten, reader, the legend of the old clock?</p>

  <p>Many years ago there lived here an aged and experienced mechanic.
  Buried in his arts, he forgot the ways of the world, and promised his
  daughter to his gallant young apprentice, instead of to the hideous
  old magistrate who approached the maiden with offers of gold and
  dignity. One day the youth and damsel found the unworldly artist
  weeping for joy before his completed clock, the wonder of the earth.
  Everybody came to see it, and the corporation bought it for the
  cathedral. The city of Basel bespoke another just like it. This order
  aroused the jealousy of the authorities, <span class="pagenum">[pg
  372]</span> who tried to make the mechanic promise that he would
  never repeat his masterpiece for another town. &quot;Heaven gave me
  not my talents to feed your vain ambition,&quot; said the man of
  craft: &quot;the men of Basel were quicker to recognize my skill than
  you were. I will make no such promise.&quot; Upon that the rejected
  suitor, who was among the magistrates, persuaded his colleagues to
  put out the artist&#39;s eyes. The old man heard his fate with lofty
  fortitude, and only asked that he might suffer the sentence in the
  presence of his darling work, to which he wished to give a few final
  strokes. His request was granted, and he gazed long at the splendid
  clock, setting its wonders in motion to count off the last remaining
  moments of his sight. &quot;Come, laggard,&quot; said the persecuting
  magistrate, who had brought a crowd of spectators, &quot;you are
  taxing the patience of this kind audience.&quot; &quot;But one touch
  remains,&quot; said the old mechanic, &quot;to complete my
  work;&quot; and he busied himself a moment among the wheels. While he
  suffered the agonies of his torture a fearful whir was heard from the
  clock: the weights tumbled crashing to the floor as his eyes fell
  from their sockets. He had removed the master-spring, and his revenge
  was complete. The lovers devoted their lives to the comfort of the
  blind clockmaker, and the wicked magistrate was hooted from society.
  The clock remained a ruin until 1842, when parts of it were used in
  the new one constructed by Schwilgué.</p><a name="image-0004" id=

  <p>I found my bluebottle professor to be a Swiss, thirty years
  resident in the city, very accessible and talkative, and, like every
  citizen by adoption, more patriotic than even the native-born.</p>

  <p>&quot;It was a cheerless time for me, sir,&quot; said he as we
  contemplated together the façade of the church, &quot;when I saw that
  spire printed in black against the flames of the town.&quot;</p>

  <p>I begged frankly for his reminiscences.</p>

  <p>&quot;The bombardment of 1870,&quot; said the professor, &quot;was
  begun purposely, in contempt of the Bonapartist tradition, on the
  15th of August, the birthday of Napoleon. At half-past eleven at
  night, just as the fireworks are usually set off on that evening, a
  shell came hissing over the city and fell upon the Bank of France,
  crushing through the skylight and shivering the whole staircase
  within: the bombardment that time lasted only half an hour, but it
  found means, after much killing and ruining among the private houses,
  to reach the buildings of the Lyceum, where we had placed the wounded
  from the army of Woerth. While the <span class="pagenum">[pg
  373]</span> city was being touched off in every direction, like a
  vast brush heap, we had to take these poor victims down into the
  cellars.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you think the bombs were purposely so directed?&quot; I
  asked.</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t talk to me of stray shots!&quot; said the burgher,
  hotly enough. &quot;The enemy was better acquainted with the city
  than we were ourselves, and his fire was of a precision that extorted
  our admiration more than once. Cannons planted in Kehl sent their
  shells high over the citadel, like blows from a friend. An artillery
  that, after the third shot, found the proper curve and bent the cross
  on the cathedral, cannot plead extenuating circumstances and stray
  shots.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Was the greatest damage done on that first
  night?&quot;</p><a name="image-0005" id="image-0005"><!--IMG--></a>

  <p>&quot;Ah no! The bombardment was addressed to us as an argument,
  proceeding by degrees, and always in a <i>crescendo</i>: after the
  15th there was silence until the 18th; after the 18th, silence up to
  the 23d. The grand victim of the 23d, you know, was the city library,
  where lay the accumulations of centuries of patient
  learning&#8212;the mediæval manuscripts, the <i>Hortus deliciarum</i>
  of Herrade of Landsberg, the monuments of early printing, the
  collections of Sturm. Ah! when we gathered around our precious
  reliquary the next day and saw its contents in ashes, amid a scene of
  silence, of people hurrying away with infants and valuable objects,
  of firemen hopelessly playing on the burned masterpieces, there was
  one thought that came into every mind&#8212;one parallel! It was Omar
  the caliph and the library of Alexandria.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And you imagine that this offence to civilization was quite
  voluntary?&quot; I argued with some doubt.</p>

  <p>&quot;It is said that General Werder acted under superior orders.
  But, sir, you must perceive that in these discretionary situations
  there is no such dangerous man as the innocent executant, the
  martinet, the person of routine, the soldier stifled in his uniform.
  I saw Werder after the capitulation. A little man, lean and bilious.
  Such was the opponent who reversed for us successively, like the
  premisses of an argument, the bank, the library, the art-museum, the
  theatre, the prefecture, the arsenal, the palace of justice, not to
  speak of our churches. A man like that was quite capable of replying,
  as he did, to a request that he would allow a safe-conduct for
  non-combatants, that the presence of <span class="pagenum">[pg
  374]</span> women and children was an element of weakness to the
  fortress of which he did not intend to deprive it.&#39; The night
  illuminated by our burning manuscripts was followed by the day which
  witnessed the conflagration of the cathedral. Look at that noble
  front, sir, contemplating us with the hoary firmness of six hundred
  years! You would think it a sad experience to see it, as I have seen
  it, crowned with flames which leaped up and licked the spire, while
  the copper on the roof curled up like paper in the heat; and to hear,
  as I heard, the poor beadles and guards, from the height of yonder
  platform, calling the city to the aid of its cathedral. The next day
  the mighty church, now so imperfectly restored, was a piteous sight.
  The flames had gone out for want of fuel. We could see the sky
  through holes in the roof. The organ-front was leaning over, pierced
  with strange gaps; the clock escaped as by miracle; and the mighty
  saints, who had been praying for centuries in the stained windows,
  were scattered upon the floor. On the 25th the systematic firing of
  the faubourgs began, and the city was filled with the choking smell
  of burning goods: on the 28th the citadel was
  kindled.&quot;</p><a name="image-0006" id="image-0006"><!--IMG--></a>

  <p>&quot;And what opposition,&quot; I naturally demanded, &quot;were
  you able to make to all this? I believe your forces were greatly
  shortened?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;We were as short as you can think, sir. Most of the garrison
  had been withdrawn by MacMahon. The soldiers still among us were
  miserably demoralized by the entrance of the fugitives from Woerth.
  Our defence was the strangest of mixtures. The custom-house officers
  were armed and mobilized: the naval captain Dupetit-Thouars happened
  to be in the walls, with some of the idle marine. Colonel Fiévée,
  with his pontoneers, hurriedly tore up the bridge of boats leading
  over to Kehl, and united himself with the garrison. From the outbreak
  of the war we civilians had been invited to form a garde nationale,
  but never was there a greater farce. We <span class="pagenum">[pg
  375]</span> were asked to choose our own grades, and when I begged to
  be made colonel, they inquired if I would not prefer to be lieutenant
  or adjutant. Most of us, those at least who had voted against the
  imperial candidates, never received a gun. Our artillery, worthy of
  the times of Louis XIV., scolded in vain from the ramparts against
  the finest cannons in the world, and we were obliged to watch the
  Prussian trenches pushing toward the town, and to hear the bullets
  beginning to fall where at first were only bombs.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The capitulation was then imminent.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;There were a few incidents in the mean time. The deputation
  from Switzerland, of ever-blessed memory, entered the city on the
  eleventh of September. Angels from heaven could not have been more
  welcome. You know that a thousand of our inhabitants passed over into
  Switzerland under conduct of the delegate from Berne, Colonel Büren,
  and that they were received like brothers. From Colonel Büren also we
  learned for the first time about Sedan, the disasters of Bazaine and
  MacMahon, and the hopelessness of the national cause. We learned
  that, while they were crowning with flowers the statue of our city in
  Paris, they had no assistance but handsome words to send us. Finally,
  we learned the proclamation of the French republic&#8212;a republic
  engendered in desolation, and so powerless to support its distant
  provinces! We too had our little republican demonstration, and on the
  20th of September the prefect they had sent us from Paris, M.
  Valentin, came dashing in like a harlequin, after running the
  gauntlet of a thousand dangers, and ripped out of his sleeve his
  official voucher from Gambetta. Alas! we were a republic for only a
  week, but that week of fettered freedom still dwells like an elixir
  in some of our hearts. For eight days I, a born Switzer, saw the
  Rhine a republican river.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Give me your hand, sir!&quot; I cried, greatly moved.
  &quot;You are talking to a republican. I am, or used to be, a citizen
  of free America!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am happy to embrace you,&quot; said the burgher; and I
  believe he was on the point of doing it, literally as well as
  figuratively. &quot;I, for my part, whatever they make of me, am at
  least an Alsatian. But I am half ashamed to talk to an American. On
  the 29th I went to see our troops evacuate the city by the Faubourg
  National. I found myself elbow to elbow in the throng with the consul
  from the United States: never in my life shall I forget the indignant
  surprise of your compatriot.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why should our consul be indignant at disaster?&quot; I
  demanded.</p><a name="image-0007" id="image-0007"><!--IMG--></a>

  <p>&quot;Why, sir, the throng that rolled toward the grave Prussian
  troops was composed of desperadoes inflamed with wine, flourishing
  broken guns and stumps of sabres, and insulting equally, with many a
  drunken oath, the conquerors and our own loyal general Uhrich. The
  American consul, blushing with shame for our common humanity, said,
  &#39;This is the second time I have watched the capitulation of an
  army. The first time it was the soldiers of General Lee, who yielded
  to the Northern troops. Those brave Confederates came toward us
  silent and dignified, bearing arms reversed, as at a funeral. We
  respected them as heroes, while here&#8212;&#39; But I cannot repeat
  to you, sir, what your representative proceeded to add. That
  revolting sight,&quot; continued my informant, &quot;was the last
  glimpse we had of France our protector. When we returned to the city
  a Prussian band played German airs to us <span class="pagenum">[pg
  376]</span> at the foot of Kleber&#39;s statue. We are Teutonized
  now. At least,&quot; concluded the burgher, taking me by the
  shoulders to hiss the words through my ears in a safe corner,
  &quot;we are Germans officially. But I, for my part, am Alsatian for
  ever and for ever!&quot;</p><a name="image-0008" id="image-0008">

  <p>Greatly delighted to have encountered so near a witness and so
  minute a chronicler of the disasters of the town, I invited the
  professor to accompany me in exploring it, my interest having vastly
  increased during his recital; but he pleaded business, and, shaking
  both my hands and smiling upon me out of a sort of moulding formed
  around his face by his shirt-collars, dismissed me. So, then, once
  more, with a hitch to my tin box, I became a lonely lounger. I viewed
  the church of Saint Thomas, the public place named after Kleber, who
  was born here, some of the markets and a beer establishment. In the
  church of Saint Thomas I examined the monument to Marshal Saxe, by
  Pigalle. I should have expected to see a simple statue of the hero in
  the act of breaking a horseshoe or rolling up a silver plate into a
  bouquet-holder, according to the Guy-Livingstone habits in which he
  appears to have passed his life, and was more surprised than edified
  at sight of the large allegorical family with which the sculptor has
  endowed him. In the same church I had the misfortune to see in the
  boxes a pair of horrible mummies, decked off with robes and
  ornaments&#8212;a count of Nassau-Saarwerden and his daughter,
  according to the custodian&#8212;an unhappy pair who, having escaped
  our common doom of corruption by some physical aridity or meagreness,
  have been compelled to leave their tombs and attitudinize as works of
  art. In Kleber&#39;s square I saw the conqueror of Heliopolis,
  excessively pigeon-breasted, dangling his sabre over a cowering
  little figure of Egypt, and looking around in amazement at the
  neighboring windows: in fact, Kleber began his career as an
  architect, and there were solecisms in the surrounding structure to
  have turned a better balanced head than his. In the markets I saw
  peasants with red waistcoats and flat faces shaded with triangles of
  felt, and peasant-girls bareheaded, with a gilded arrow apparently
  shot through their brains. I traversed the Street of the Great
  Arcades, and saw the statue of Gutenberg, of whom, as well as of
  Peter Schöffer, the natives seem to be proud, though they were but
  type-setters. Finally, in the Beer-hall, that of the dauphin, I
  tasted a thimble-ful of inimitable beer, the veritable beer of
  Strasburg. Already, at half-past eight on that fine May morning, I
  persuaded myself that I had seen everything, so painful had my feet
  become by pounding over the pavements.</p>

  <p>My friend the engineer had agreed to breakfast with me at the
  hotel. When <span class="pagenum">[pg 377]</span> I entered the
  dining-room with the intention of waiting for him, I found two
  individuals sitting at table. One was no other than the red-nosed
  Scotchman, the Eleusinian victim whom I had watched through the
  bottle-rack at Épernay. Of the second I recognized the architectural
  back, the handsomely rolled and faced blue coat and the marble
  volutes of his Ionic shirt-collar: it was my good friend of the
  cathedral. Every trace of his civic grief had disappeared, and he
  wore a beaming banquet-room air, though the tear of patriotism was
  hardly dry upon his cheek.</p>

  <p>As I paused to dispose of my accoutrements the red nose was
  saying, &quot;Yes, my dear sir, since yesterday I am a Mason. I have
  the honor,&quot; he pursued, &quot;to be First Attendant Past Grand.
  It will be a great thing for me at Edinburgh. Burns, I believe, was
  only Third Assistant, Exterior Lodge: the Rank, however, in his
  opinion, was but the guinea&#39;s stamp. But the advantages of
  Masonry are met with everywhere. Already in the train last night I
  struck the acquaintance of a fine fellow, a Mason like
  myself.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Allow me to ask,&quot; said the cheerful bluebottle,
  &quot;how you knew him for a Mason like yourself?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you. I was unable to sleep, because, you see,
  I had to drink Moët for my initiation: as I am unaccustomed to
  anything livelier than whisky, it unnerved me. To pass the time I
  went softly over the signals.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What signals, if I may be so indiscreet?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Number one, you scratch the nose, as if to chase a fly;
  number two, you put your thumb in your mouth; number
  three&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;H&#39;m!&quot; said the professor doubtfully, &quot;those
  are singular instructions, scratching the nose and sucking the thumb.
  It strikes me they have been teaching you nursery signals rather than
  Masonry signals.&quot;</p><a name="image-0009" id="image-0009">

  <p>&quot;My good friend,&quot; said the Scot with extreme politeness,
  yet not without dignity, &quot;you cannot understand it, because you
  were not present. I received a Light which burned my eyelashes. The
  sage always examines a mystery before he decides upon it. My Masonic
  friend will be here at breakfast to-day: he promised me. Only wait
  for him. He can explain these things better than I, you will see. The
  little experiments with our noses and thumbs, you understand, are
  symbols&#8212;Thummim and Urim, or something of that kind.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Or else nonsense. You have been quizzed, I fear.&quot;</p>

  <p>The North Briton bridled his head, knitted his brows and pushed
  back his <span class="pagenum">[pg 378]</span> chair; then, after a
  moment of pregnant and stormy silence, he turned suddenly around to
  me, who was enjoying the comedy&#8212;&quot;Hand me the
  cheese.&quot;</p>

  <p>To be taken for a waiter amused me. Never in the world would a
  domestic have dared to present himself in a hotel habited as I was. I
  was in the same clothes with which I had left Passy the morning
  previous: my coat was peppered with dust, my linen bruised and dingy,
  my tie was nodding doubtfully over my right shoulder. A waiter in my
  condition would have been kicked out without arrears of wages.</p>

  <p>The professor, looking quickly around, recognized me with a
  ludicrous endeavor to relapse into the fiery and outraged patriot. He
  expended his temper on the red nose. &quot;Take care whom you speak
  to,&quot; he cried in a high, portly voice, and pointing to my
  japanned box, which I had slung upon a curtain-hook. &quot;Monsieur
  is not an attaché of the house. Monsieur is doubtless an
  herb-doctor.&quot;</p><a name="image-0010" id="image-0010">

  <p>There are charlatans who pervade the provincial parts of France,
  stopping a month at a time in the taverns, and curing the ignorant
  with samples according to the old system of
  <i>simulacra</i>&#8212;prescribing kepatica for liver, lentils for
  the eyes and green walnuts for vapors, on account of their supposed
  correspondence to the different organs. I settled my cravat at the
  mirror to contradict my resemblance to a waiter, threw my box into a
  wine-cooler to dispose of my identity with the equally uncongenial
  herbalist, and took a seat. Nodding paternally to the coat of
  Prussian blue, I proceeded to order Bordeaux-Léoville, capon with
  Tarragon sauce, compôte of nectarines in Madeira jelly&#8212;all
  superfluous, for I was brutally hungry, and wanted chops and coffee;
  but what will not an unsupported candidate for respectability do when
  he desires to assert his caste? I was proceeding to ruin myself in
  playing the eccentric millionaire when the door opened, giving
  entrance to a group of breakfasters.</p>

  <p>&quot;There he is&#8212;that&#39;s the man!&quot; said the
  homoeopathist, much excited, and indicating to the blue coat a brisk,
  capable-looking gentleman of thirty-two in a neat silver-gray
  overcoat. The latter, after slightly touching his nose, nodded to the
  Scotchman, who in return drew himself up to his full height and
  formally wiped his mouth with a napkin, as if preparing himself for
  an ovation. Happily, he contented himself with rubbing his own nose
  with each hand in turn, and bowing so profoundly that he appeared
  ready to break at the knees.</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Kellner</i>!&quot; said the silver-gray, making a grand
  rattle among the plates and glasses, &quot;some wine! some water!
  some ink! an omelette! a writing-pad! a <i>filet à la
  Chabrillant</i>!&quot;</p>

  <p>The last-named dish is one which Sciolists are perpetually calling
  <i>filet à la Chateaubriand</i>, saddling the poetic defender of
  Christianity with an invention in cookery of which he was never
  capable. I approved the new-comer, who was writing half a dozen notes
  with his mouth full, for his nicety in nomenclature: to get the right
  term, even in kitchen affairs, shows a reflective mind and tenderness
  of conscience. My friend the engineer arrived, and placed himself in
  the chair I had turned up beside my own. I was ashamed of the rate at
  which I advanced through my capon, but I recollected that Anne
  Boleyn, when she was a maid of honor, used to breakfast off a gallon
  of ale and a chine of beef.</p>

  <p>My canal-maker interrupted me with a sudden appeal.
  &quot;Listen&#8212;listen yonder,&quot; he said, jogging my knee,
  &quot;it is very amusing. He is in a high vein to-day.&quot;</p>

  <p>The gray coat, who had already directed four or five letters, and
  was cleaning his middle finger with a lemon over the glass bowl, had
  just opened a lofty geographical discussion with the blue-bottle.
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 379]</span> I cannot express how eagerly I,
  as a theorist of some pretension in Comparative Geography, awoke to a
  discussion in which my dearest opinions were concerned.</p>

  <p>&quot;Geography,&quot; the active gentleman was saying as he
  dipped his finger in water to attach the flaps of his
  envelopes&#8212;&quot;geography, my dear professor, is the most
  neglected of modern sciences. Excuse me if I take from under you, for
  a moment, your doctoral chair, and land you on one of the forms of
  the primary department. I would ask a simple elementary question: How
  many parts of the globe are there?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Before the loss of Alsace and Lorraine,&quot; said the
  professor with plaintive humor, &quot;I always reckoned
  six.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very well: on this point we agree.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Six!&quot; said the Scotchman in great surprise. &quot;You
  are liberal: I make but five.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Not one less than six,&quot; said the patriot, vastly
  encouraged with the support he got: &quot;am I not right, sir? We
  have, first, Europe&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah, professor,&quot; said the silver-gray, interrupting him,
  &quot;how is this? You, such a distinguished scholar&#8212;you still
  believe in Europe? Why, my dear sir, Europe no longer
  exists&#8212;certainly not as a quarter of the globe. It is simply,
  as Humboldt very truly remarks in his <i>Cosmos</i>, the
  septentrional point of Asia.&quot;</p>

  <p>The surprise seemed to pass, at this point, from the face of the
  Scot to that of the Strasburger. After reflecting a moment,
  &quot;Really,&quot; murmured he, &quot;I recollect, in
  <i>Cosmos</i>&#8212;But how, then, do you reach six parts of the
  globe?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Only count, professor: Asia, one; Africa, two; Australia,
  three; Oceanica, four; North America, five; and South America,
  six.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You cut America in two?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nature has taken that responsibility. Each part of the world
  being necessarily an insulated continent, an enormous island, it is
  too much to ask me to confound the northern and southern continents
  of America, hung together by a thread&#8212;a thread which messieurs
  the engineers&quot;&#8212;he bowed airily to my
  companion&#8212;&quot;have very probably severed by this
  time.&quot;</p>

  <p>The honest professor passed his hand over his forehead. &quot;The
  deuce!&quot; he said. &quot;That is logic perhaps. Still, sir, I
  think it is rather hardy in you to double America and annihilate
  Europe, when Europe discovered America.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The Europeans did not discover America,&quot; replied the
  young philosopher. &quot;The Americans discovered Europe.&quot;</p>

  <p>The professor of geography remained stunned: the homoeopathist
  gave utterance to a cry&#8212;one of admiration, doubtless.</p>

  <p>&quot;An American colony was settled in Norway long before the
  arrival of Columbus in Santo Domingo: who will contradict me when
  Humboldt says so? Only read your <i>Cosmos</i>!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The dickens! prodigious! prodigious!&quot; repeated the man
  of blue. The young silver coat went on:</p><a name="image-0011" id=

  <p>&quot;I have been three times around the world, professor. The
  terrestrial globe was my only chart. I have studied in their places
  its divisions, continents, capes and oceans; also the customs,
  politics and philosophies of its inhabitants. I have a weakness for
  learning; I have caused myself to be initiated in all secret and
  philosophical societies; I have taken a degree from the Brahmans of
  Benares; I have received the accolade from the emir of the Druses; I
  have been instructed by the priests of the Grand Lama, and have
  joined the Society of Pure Illumination, the sole possessors of the
  Future Light. I have just returned from Persia, where I received the
  blessing of the great Bâb; and, like Solomon, I can say, <i>Vanitas
  vanitatum</i>!&quot;</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 380]</span>

  <p>The red nose was by this time quite inflated and inflamed with
  disinterested pride. The blue was crushed, but he made a final
  effort, as the silver-gray made his preparations to depart and
  adjusted his breakfast-bill. &quot;Pardon me, sir,&quot; he said,
  with a little infusion of provincial pride. &quot;I am not a
  cosmopolitan, a Constantinopolitan or a Bâbist. But I enjoy your
  conversation, and am not entirely without the ability to sympathize
  in your geographical calculations. I am preparing at the present
  moment a small treatise on Submarine Geography; I am conducting, if
  that gives me any right to be heard, the geographical department in
  the chief gymnasium here: in addition, my youngest sister lost her
  ulnar bone by the explosion of an obus in the seminary on the night
  of August 18th, when six innocent infants were killed or maimed by
  the Prussians, who put a bomb in their little beds like a
  warming-pan.&quot;</p><a name="image-0012" id="image-0012">

  <p>&quot;Never mind the warming-pan,&quot; said the traveler kindly,
  seeing that the professor was making himself cry, and unconsciously
  quoting Pickwick.</p>

  <p>&quot;I will not dilate on my title to trouble you for a few words
  more. I perceive that I shall have a good deal to modify in my modest
  treatise. I beg you to give us your views on some of the
  modifications now going on in the East, especially the Turkish
  question and the civilization of China.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear professor,&quot; said the youthful Crichton
  sententiously, &quot;do not disturb yourself with those problems,
  which are already disposed of. In twenty years the sultan will become
  a monk, to get rid of the chief sultana, who has pestered his life
  out with her notions of woman&#39;s rights, and who wore the Bloomer
  costume before the Crimean war. As for the question about China, it
  is better to let sleeping dogs lie: it has been a great mistake to
  arouse China, for it is a dog that drags after it three hundred
  millions of pups. Only see the effect already in Lima and San
  Francisco! Before a century has elapsed all Asia, with Alaska and the
  Pacific part of America, to say nothing of that petty extremity you
  persist in calling Europe, will be in the power of China. Your little
  girls, professor, will be more liable to lose their feet than their
  arms, for it is a hundred chances to one but your great-grand-nieces
  grow up Chinawomen.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Astonishing!&quot; murmured the professor of geography.</p>

  <p>&quot;Admirable!&quot; cried the doctor.</p>

  <p>I had hitherto said nothing, though I was capitally entertained.
  At length I ventured to take up my own parable, and, addressing the
  pretended disciple of the Brahmans, I asked, &quot;Can you enlighten
  us, sir, on the true reason of the revolt of the slave States in
  America?&quot;</p>

  <p>The cosmopolitan, by this time standing, turned to me with a
  courteous motion of acquiescence; and, after having given me to
  understand by an agreeable smile that he did not confound me with his
  pair of victims, he said pompously, &quot;The true cause was that
  each Northern freeholder demanded the use of two planters, now mostly
  octoroons, for body-servants.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You don&#39;t say so?&quot; said the school-teacher,
  profoundly impressed.</p>

  <p>The Scotchman looked like him who digesteth a pill. I decided
  quickly on my own rôle, and briskly joined the conversation. Fishing
  up my botany-box and extracting the little flower, &quot;Nothing is
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 381]</span> more likely when you know the
  country,&quot; I observed. &quot;I have lived in Florida, gentlemen,
  where I undertook, as Comparative Geographer and as amateur
  botanist&quot; (I looked searchingly at the professor, who had called
  me an herb-doctor), &quot;to fix the location of Ponce de Leon&#39;s
  fountain and observe the medicinal plants to which it owes its
  virtue. America, I must explain to you, is a country where
  proportions are greatly changed. The pineapple tree there grows so
  very tall that it is impossible from the ground to reach the fruit.
  This little flower now in my hand becomes in that climate a towering
  and sturdy plant, the tobacco plant. The wild justice of those
  lawless savannahs uses it as a gibbet for the execution of criminals,
  whence the term &#39;Lynchburg tobacco.&#39; You cannot readily
  imagine the scale on which life expands. It was formerly not
  necessary to be a great man there to have a hundred slaves. For my
  part, sixty domestics sufficed me&quot; (I regarded sternly the
  homoeopathist, who had taken me for a waiter): &quot;it was but a
  scant allowance, since my pipe alone took the whole time of
  four.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said the Scotchman, &quot;allow me to doubt. I
  understand the distribution of blood among the planters, because I am
  a homoeopathist; but what could your pipe gain by being diluted among
  four men?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The first filled it, the second lighted it, the third handed
  it and the fourth smoked it. I hate tobacco.&quot;</p>

  <p>The witticism appeared generally agreeable, and I laughed with the
  rest. The cheerful philosopher in the gray coat passed out: as he
  left the room, followed subserviently by his interlocutors, he bowed
  very pleasantly to me and shook hands with my guardian the
  engineer.</p>

  <p>&quot;You know him?&quot; I said to the latter.</p>

  <p>&quot;Just as well as you,&quot; he replied: &quot;is it possible
  you don&#39;t recognize him? It is Fortnoye.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What! Fortnoye&#8212;the Ancient of the wine-cellar at
  Épernay?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In truth it is the same jolly voice. Then his white beard
  was a disguise?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What would you have?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am glad he is the same: I began to think the mystifiers
  here were as dangerous as those of the champagne country. At any
  rate, he is a bright fellow.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He is not always bright. A man with so good a heart as his
  must be saddened sometimes, at least with others&#39; woes, and he
  does not always escape woes of his own.&quot;</p>

  <p>This sentiment affected me, and irritated me a little besides, for
  I felt that it was in my own vein, and that it was I who had a right
  to the observation. I immediately quoted an extract from an Icelandic
  Saga to the effect that dead bees give a stinging quality to the very
  metheglin of the gods. We exchanged these remarks in crossing the
  vestibule of the hotel: a carriage was standing there for my
  friend.</p>

  <p>&quot;I am sorry to leave you. I have a meeting with a Prussian
  engineer about bridges and canals and the waterworks of Vauban, and
  everything that would least interest you. I must cross immediately to
  Kehl. I leave you to finish the geography of Strasburg.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I know Strasburg by heart, and am burning to get out of it.
  I want to cross the Rhine, for the sake of boasting that I have set
  foot in the Baden territory. By the by, how have I managed to come so
  far without a passport?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>This</i> did it,&quot; said my engineer, tapping the tin
  box, which a waiter had restored to me in a wonderful state of
  polish. &quot;I put a plan or two in it, with some tracing muslin,
  and allowed a spirit-level to stick out. You were asleep. I know all
  the officials on this route. I had only to tap the box and nod. You
  passed as my assistant. Nobody could have put you through but
  I.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You are a vile conspirator,&quot; said I affectionately,
  &quot;and have all the lower traits of the Yankee character. But I
  will use you to carry me to Kehl, as Faust used Mephistopheles. By
  the by, your carriage is a comfortable one and saves my time. I have
  two hours before I need return to the train.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is double the time you will need.&quot;</p>

  <p>An old writer who dearly loved excursions, Francis Rabelais,
  inserted in one of his fables an account of a country where the roads
  were in motion. He called the place the Island of Odes, from the
  Greek [Greek: odss], a &quot;road,&quot; and explained: &quot;For the
  roads travel, like animated things; and some are wandering roads,
  like planets, others passing roads, crossing roads, connecting roads.
  And I saw how the travelers, messengers and inhabitants of the land
  asked, Where does this road go to? and that? They were answered, From
  the south to Faverolles, to the parish, to the city, to the river.
  Then hoisting themselves on the proper road, without being otherwise
  troubled or fatigued, they found themselves at their place of
  destination.&quot;</p>

  <p>This fancy sketch, thrown off by an inveterate joker three hundred
  years ago, is justified curiously by any of our modern railways; but
  to see the picture represented in startling accuracy you should find
  some busy &quot;junction&quot; among the coal-mountains. Here you may
  observe, from your perch upon the hill, an assemblage of roads
  actively reticulating and radiating, winding through the valleys,
  slinking off misanthropically into a tunnel, or gayly parading away
  elbow-in-elbow with the streams. These avenues, upon minute
  inspection, are seen to be obviously moving: they are crawling and
  creeping with an unbroken joint-work of black wagons, the rails
  hidden by their moving pavement, and the road throughout advancing,
  foot by foot, into the distance. It is hardly too fanciful&#8212;on
  seeing its covering slide away, its switches swinging, its
  turn-tables revolving, its drawbridges opening&#8212;to declare that
  such a road is an animal&#8212;an animal proving its nature,
  according to Aristotle, by the power to move itself. Nor is it at all
  censurable <span class="pagenum">[pg 383]</span> to ask of a road
  like this where it &quot;goes to.&quot;</p>

  <p>The notion of what Rabelais calls a &quot;wayfaring way,&quot; a
  <i>chemin cheminant</i>, came into our thoughts at Cumberland. But
  Cumberland was not reached until after many miles of interesting
  travel along a route remarkable for beauties, both natural and
  improved. A coal-distributor is certain, in fact, to be a road full
  of attractions for the tourist; for coal, that Sleeping Beauty of our
  era, always chooses a pretty bed in which to perform its slumber of
  ages. The road which delivers the Cumberland coal, however, is truly
  exceptional for splendor of scenery, as well as for historical
  suggestiveness and engineering science. It has recently become, by
  means of certain lavish providences established for the blessing of
  travelers at every turn, a tourist route and a holiday delight.</p>

  <p>It is all very well for the traveler of the nineteenth century to
  protest against the artificial and unromantic guidance of the
  railway: he will find, after a little experience, that the homes of
  true romance are discovered for him by the locomotive; that solitudes
  and recesses which he would never find after years of plodding in
  sandal shoon are silently opened to him by the engineer; and that
  Timon now, seeking the profoundest cave in the fissures of the earth,
  reaches it in a Pullman car.</p>

  <p>The silvery Capitoline dome at Washington floats up from among its
  garden trees, seeming to grow higher and higher as we recede from it.
  Quickly dominating the low and mean buildings which encumber and try
  to hide it in its own neighborhood, it gradually rises superior to
  the whole city, growing greater as Washington grows less. The first
  part of the course is over the loop of road newly acquired and still
  improving by the company&#8212;a loop hanging downward from
  Baltimore, so as to sweep over Washington, and confer upon the
  through traveler the gift of an excursion through the capital. This
  loop swings southwardly from Baltimore to a point near Frederick,
  Washington being set upon it like a bead in the midst. The older
  road, like a mathematical chord, stretches still between the first
  points, but is occupied with the carrying of freight. The tourist
  notices the stout beams of the bridges, the new look of the sleepers,
  and the sheen of the double lines of fresh steel rail: he observes
  some heavy mason-work at the Monocacy River. Two hours have passed:
  at Frederick Junction he joins a road whose cuttings are grass-grown,
  whose quarried rocks are softened with lichen. He is struck by the
  change, and with reason, for he is now being carried under the
  privileges of the first railroad charter granted in America.</p>

  <p>We may not here undertake the story of the iron track, though it
  is from this very road that such a story must take its departure, and
  though we cannot grant that that story would be exceeded by any in
  the range of the author&#39;s skill as a matter of popular interest.
  This railroad, this &quot;Baltimore and Ohio&quot; artery, connects,
  through its origin, with the very beginnings of modern progress, and
  indeed with feudalism; for it was opened in 1828 by Charles Carroll,
  the patriot who had staked his broad lands of Carrollton in 1776
  against the maintenance of feudalism in this country. &quot;I
  consider this,&quot; said Carroll, after his slender and aristocratic
  hand had relinquished the spade, &quot;among the most important acts
  of my life&#8212;second only to my signing the Declaration of
  Independence.&quot; Railroads, excepting coal-mine trams, were as yet
  untried; Stephenson had not yet exhibited the Rocket; for travel and
  transportation the locomotive was unknown, and the Baltimoreans
  conceived their scheme while yet uncertain whether horse-power or
  <i>stationary</i> steam-engines would be the best acting force. It
  was opened as far as Ellicott&#39;s Mills as a horse-road, the idlers
  and beauties of Baltimore participating in the excursion as a novel
  jest. In 1830, Baron Krudener, the envoy from Russia, rode upon it in
  a car with sails, called the Æolus, a model of which he sent to the
  emperor Nicholas as something new and hopeful. Passing the Monocacy,
  we roll over a rich champaign country, based upon <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 384]</span> limestone&#8212;the garden of the State,
  and containing the ancient manor of Carrollton, through whose
  grounds, by one of its branches, this road passes for miles. Near by
  are quarries of Breccia marble&#8212;a conglomerate of cemented
  variegated pebbles&#8212;out of which were cut the rich pillars in
  the House of Representatives at Washington. The Monocacy is crossed,
  near whose bank lies the bucolic old Maryland town of Frederick, to
  attain which a twig of the road wanders off for the few necessary
  miles. Soon the piquant charms of Potomac scenery are at hand, the
  mountains are marching upon us, and the road becomes stimulating.</p>

  <p>A jagged spur of the Blue Ridge, the Catoctin Mountain, strides
  out to the river, and the railroad, striking it, wraps itself around
  the promontory in a sharp curve, like a blow with the flat of an
  elastic Damascus sword. The broad Potomac sweeps rushing around its
  base: it is the celebrated Point of Rocks. The nodding precipice, cut
  into a rough and tortured profile by the engineers, lays its shadow
  to sleep on the whizzing roofs of the cars as they glitter by,
  (Shadows always seem to print themselves with additional distinctness
  upon any moving object, like a waterfall or a foaming stream.) There
  are a village and a bridge at the Point, and the mountain-range,
  broken in two by the river, recovers itself gracefully and loftily on
  the other side.</p><a name="image-0014" id="image-0014">

  <p>For half an hour more, as we rush to meet the course of the
  Potomac, the broad ledges that heave the bed of the river into
  mounds, and the ascending configuration of the shore, seem to speak
  of something grand, and directly we are in the cradle of romance, at
  Harper&#39;s Ferry.</p>

  <p>To reach this village, perhaps the most picturesque in the
  country, we must cross the Potomac from Maryland into Virginia. The
  bridge is peculiar and artistic. It is about nine hundred feet long;
  its two ends are curved in opposite directions, and at its farther
  extremity it splits curiously into two bridge-branches, one of which
  supports the road running up the Shenandoah, while the other carries
  the main road along the Potomac. The latter fork of the bridge runs
  for half a mile up the course of the Potomac <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 385]</span> stream over the water, the road having been
  denied footing upon the shore on account of the presence there of the
  government arsenal buildings. The effect to the eye is very curious:
  the arsenal is at present razed to the level of the ground (having
  been fired, the reader will remember, by the Federal guard at the
  beginning of hostilities, and some fifteen thousand stand of arms
  burnt to prevent their falling into Lee&#39;s hands), and there is no
  topographical reason to prevent the track running comfortably on dry
  ground. The arrangements, however, for purchasing the right to a
  road-bed on the arsenal grounds, though under way, are not yet
  complete, and the road marches on aquatically, as aforesaid.</p>

  <p>Harper&#39;s Ferry, a town supported of old almost entirely by the
  arsenal works, is a desolate little stronghold among towering
  mountains, the ruins being in the foreground. The precipices on
  either side of the river belong to the Elk Ridge, through which, at
  some antediluvian period, the colossal current has hewed its way. At
  the base of the Virginia side of the mountains, hugged in by the
  Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, and by Loudon and Bolivar Heights,
  cowers the town.</p><a name="image-0015" id="image-0015">

  <p>Across the river towers the mighty cupola of Maryland Height, far
  overtopping the other peaks, and farther down the stream, like a
  diminishing reflection of it, the softer swell of South Mountain. An
  ordinary rifle-cannon on Maryland Height can with the greatest ease
  play at bowls to the other summits. From this eminence one Colonel
  Ford, on September 13, 1862, toppled down his spiked and coward
  cannon: the hostile guns of the enemy quickly swarmed up the summit
  he had abandoned, and the Virginia crests of Loudon and Bolivar
  belched with rebel artillery. The town was surrendered by Colonel
  Miles at the very moment when McClellan, pressing forward through the
  passes of South Mountain from Frederick, was at hand to relieve it:
  Miles was killed, and the considerable military stores left in the
  village were bagged by Stonewall Jackson. Flushed with this temporary
  advantage, Jackson proceeded to join Lee, who then advanced from
  Sharpsburg and gave unsuccessful battle to the Union forces at
  Antietam Creek.</p>

  <p>This stream pours into the Potomac just above, from the Maryland
  side. It gives its name to one of the most interesting actions of the
  war. The fields of Antietam and Gettysburg were the only two great
  battle grounds on which the <span class="pagenum">[pg 386]</span>
  Confederates played the rôle of invaders and left the protection of
  their native States. Antietam was the first, and if it could have
  been made for Lee a more decisive failure, might have prevented
  Gettysburg. It occurred September 15th to 18th, 1862. Lee had just
  thoroughly whipped that handsome Western braggart, General Pope, and,
  elated with success, thought he could assume the offensive, cross the
  Potomac, and collect around his banner great armies of dissatisfied
  secessionists to the tune of &quot;Maryland, my Maryland.&quot;
  McClellan (then in the last month of his command over the army of the
  Potomac) pushed with unwonted vigor over the mountains, inspired, it
  is said, by the accidental foreknowledge of Lee&#39;s whole Maryland
  plan, and clashed with Lee across the bridges of this pretty highland
  stream. As an episode he lost Harper&#39;s Ferry; but that was a
  trifle. It was a murderous duel, that which raged around the Dunker
  church and over the road leading from Sharpsburg to Hagerstown.
  Lee&#39;s forty thousand men were shielded by an elbow of the
  Potomac; his batteries of horse-artillery under Stuart were murdering
  the forces of Hooker, when that general was relieved by the support
  of Mansfield; then Mansfield was killed and Hooker wounded; and then
  Sedgwick was sent up to replace Mansfield; then, when Sedgwick was
  getting the better of Jackson and Hood, McLaws and Walker drew up to
  the Confederate left, and burst completely through Sedgwick&#39;s
  line. Presently, Franklin and Smith came across from the stream and
  reinforced the Federals, driving the Southern advance back to the
  church, and Burnside rendered some hesitating assistance; but then
  rushed up the force which had received the surrender of Harper&#39;s
  Ferry, singing victory, and drove back Burnside; and when McClellan,
  on the morning of the 19th, found that Lee had withdrawn across the
  Potomac, he was too much discouraged with his own hurts to venture a
  pursuit. He had lost twelve thousand men, and Lee eight thousand. But
  Antietam, though for us a costly and unsatisfactory victory, was for
  the South a conclusive lesson. The Peter-the-Hermit excursion into
  Maryland lasted just two weeks, and its failure was signal and
  instructive. Intended as an invasion that should result in the
  occupation of Washington and Philadelphia, it led to nothing but to
  Stuart&#39;s audacious raid into Pennsylvania with his thousand
  troopers&#8212;a theatrical flourish to wind up an unsuccessful
  drama. As for Harper&#39;s Ferry, its overwhelming punishment and
  precipitate conquest were not without their use: the retention by the
  Federals of the little depot of army stores on the Virginia bank
  surprised and thwarted Lee. To reduce it, he had to pause, and ere
  the operation was complete McClellan was upon him, and cornered him
  before he was enabled to take up a firm position in Western Maryland
  and prepare for the Pennsylvania invasion. The Ferry fell into our
  hands again, but as a ruin. As for the elaborate bridge approaching
  it, its history is the history of the Potomac campaign: three times
  has it been destroyed by the Confederates, and twice by the
  Unionists. Eight times it has been carried away by freshets.</p>

  <p>An earlier interest, yet intimately connected with the rebellion,
  belongs to Harper&#39;s Ferry. From the car window you see the old
  engine-house where John Brown fortified himself, and was wounded and
  captured, while these wooded hills were bathed with October red in
  1859. The breaches in the walls where he stood his siege are still
  apparent, filled in with new brickwork. No single life could have
  been so effectually paid out as his was, for he cemented in the cause
  of the North the whole abolition sentiment of the civilized world,
  and gained our army unnumbered recruits. Truly said the slaves when
  he died, &quot;Massa Brown is not buried: he is planted.&quot;</p>

  <p>Of the site of all these storied ruins we can only say again and
  again that it is beautiful. The rocky steeps that enclose the town
  have a Scottish air, and traveled visitors, beholding them, are fain
  to allude to the Trosachs; but the river that rolls through the
  mountains, <span class="pagenum">[pg 387]</span> and has whirled them
  into a hollow as the potter turns a vase, is continental in its
  character, and plunges through the landscape with a swell of eddy and
  a breadth of muscle that are like nothing amid the basking Scottish
  waters.</p>

  <p>On an eminence immediately overlooking Harper&#39;s Ferry, and
  some four hundred feet thereabove, is the enormous turtle-shaped
  rock, curiously blocked up over a fissure, on which Jefferson once
  inscribed his name. Chimney Rock, a detached column on the Shenandoah
  near by, is a sixty-foot high natural tower, described by Jefferson
  in his <i>Notes on Virginia</i>. Upon the precipice across the river,
  on the Maryland side, the fancy of the tourist has discovered a
  figure of Napoleon: it forms a bas-relief of stupendous proportions,
  having the broad cliff for background, and clearly defining the hair,
  the Corsican profile and the bust, with an epaulette on the shoulder.
  The Blue Ridge, as it traverses from this point the breadth of
  Virginia, breaks into various natural eccentricities&#8212;the Peaks
  of Otter, rising a mile above the sea, the Natural Bridge,
  Weyer&#39;s Cave, Madison&#39;s Cave&#8212;and gives issue to those
  rich heated and mineralized springs for which the State is
  famous.</p><a name="image-0016" id="image-0016"><!--IMG--></a>

  <p>The tinge of regret with which we leave Harper&#39;s Ferry is
  mitigated by the hope that greater wonders may lie beyond. In two
  miles the railroad, as if willing to carve out a picture-frame in
  which the heroic river may be viewed, excavates the &quot;Potomac
  Tunnel,&quot; as it is named, through which the water is seen like a
  design in <i>repoussé</i> silver, with two or three emerald islands
  in it for jewel-work. The perforation is eighty feet through, but in
  contrast with its rocky breadth our picture-frame is not too deep:
  whenever we shift our position, the view seems to increase in
  art-beauty, and as a final comprehensive picture it recedes and
  crowds under the spandrels of the arch the whole mountain-pass, with
  the confluence of the two rivers in the finest imaginable aspect.</p>

  <p>Poor Martinsburg! during the rebellion a mere sieve, through which
  the tide of war poured back and forth in the various fluctuations of
  our fortune! It <span class="pagenum">[pg 388]</span> is said to have
  been occupied by both armies, alternately, fifteen times. The
  passenger sees it as a mere foreground of big restaurant and
  platform, with a conglomeration of village houses in the
  rear&#8212;featureless as the sheep which the painter of Wakefield
  put in for nothing. One incident, however, supervenes. An old man,
  with positive voice and manners, and altogether a curious specimen in
  looks, gait and outfit, comes through the train with a pannier of
  apples and groundnuts. He is pointed out as one of the men of
  importance in Martinsburg, owning a row of flourishing houses. With
  the anxious servility which wealth always commands, we purchase an
  apple of this capitalist, blandly choosing a knotty and unsalable
  specimen.</p>

  <p>Pretty soon, as we look over into Maryland, we have indicated for
  us the site of old Fort Frederick, until lately traceable, but now
  completely obliterated. It was an interesting relic of the old Indian
  wars. Shortly after Braddock&#39;s defeat on the Monongahela, when
  the Indians had become very bold, and had almost depopulated this
  part of Maryland, Fort Frederick was erected by Governor Sharpe as a
  menace, and garrisoned with two hundred men. It was an immediate
  moral victory, awing and restraining the savages, though no decided
  conflict is known to have occurred from its construction to its quiet
  rotting away within the present generation. Those were the days when
  Frederick in Maryland and Chambersburg in Pennsylvania were frontier
  points, the Alleghanies were Pillars of Hercules, and all beyond was
  a blank!</p>

  <p>Still continuing our course on the Virginia side of the Potomac,
  through what is known in this State as the Virginia Valley, while in
  Pennsylvania the same intervale is called the Cumberland Valley, we
  admire the increasing sense of solitude, the bowery wildness of the
  river-banks, and the spirited freshness of the hastening water. At a
  station of delightful loneliness we alight.</p>

  <p>Here Sir John&#39;s Run comes leaping from the hills to slide
  gurgling into the Potomac, and at this point we attain Berkeley
  Springs by a dragging ascent of two miles and a half in a comfortable
  country stage. Sir John&#39;s Run was called after Sir John Sinclair,
  a quartermaster in the doomed army of Braddock. The outlet into the
  Potomac is a scene of quiet country beauty, made dignified by the
  hills around the river. A hot, rustic station of two or three rooms,
  an abandoned factory building&#8212;tall, empty-windowed and
  haunted-looking&#8212;gone clean out for want of commerce, like a
  lamp for lack of oil. Opposite the station a pretty homespun tavern
  trellised with grapes, a portrait of General Lee in the sitting-room,
  and a fat, buxom Virginia matron for hostess. All this quiet scene
  was once the locality of the hot hopes and anxieties of genius, and
  it is for this reason we linger here.</p>

  <p>When the little harbor at the mouth of Sir John&#39;s Run was
  still more wild and lonely than now, James Rumsey, a working
  bath-tender at Berkeley Springs, launched upon it a boat that he had
  invented of novel principle and propulsive force. The force was
  steam, and Rumsey had shown his model to Washington in 1780. First
  discoverers of steam-locomotion are turning up every few months in
  embarrassing numbers, but we cannot feel that we have a right to
  suppress the claims of honest Rumsey, the protégé of Washington. The
  dates are said to be as follows: Rumsey launched his steamboat here
  at Sir John&#39;s Run in 1784, before the general and a throng of
  visitors from the Springs; in 1788, John Fitch launched another first
  steamboat on the Delaware, and sent it successfully up to Burlington;
  in 1807, Robert Fulton set a third first steamboat on the Hudson, the
  Clermont. Rumsey&#39;s motion was obtained by the reaction of a
  current <i>squirted</i> through the stern of the boat against the
  water of the river, the current being pumped by steam. This action,
  so primitive, so remote from the principle of the engine now used,
  seems hardly worthy to be connected with the great revolutionary
  invention of steam-travel; yet Washington certified his opinion that
  &quot;the discovery is of vast importance, and may be of the greatest
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 389]</span> usefulness in our inland
  navigation.&quot; James Rumsey, with just a suspicion of the
  irritability of talent, accused Fitch of &quot;coming pottering
  around&quot; his Virginia work-bench and carrying off his ideas, to
  be afterward developed in Philadelphia. It is certain that the
  development was great. Rumsey died in England of apoplexy at a public
  lecture where he was explaining his contrivance.</p>

  <p>A sun-burnt, dark-eyed young Virginian now guides us up the
  mountain-road to the Springs, where we find a full-blown Ems set in
  the midst of the wilderness. The Springs of Berkeley, originally
  included in the estates of Lord Fairfax, and by him presented to the
  colony, were the first fashionable baths opened in this country. One
  half shudders to think how primitive they were in the first ages,
  when the pools were used by the sexes alternately, and the skurrying
  nymphs hastened to retreat at the notification that their hour was
  out and that the gentlemen wanted to come in. They were populous and
  civilized in the pre-Revolutionary era when Washington began to
  frequent them and became part owner in the surrounding land. The
  general&#39;s will mentions his property in &quot;Bath,&quot; as the
  settlement was then called. The Baroness de Reidesel (wife of the
  German general of that name taken with Burgoyne at Saratoga) spent
  with her invalid husband the summer of 1779 at Berkeley, making the
  acquaintance of Washington and his family; and whole pages of her
  memoirs are devoted to the quaint picture of watering-place life at
  that date.</p><a name="image-0017" id="image-0017"><!--IMG--></a>

  <p>Berkeley Springs are probably as enjoyable as any on the
  continent. There is none of that aspect of desolation and
  pity-my-sorrows so common at the faded resorts of the unhappy South,
  yet a pleasant rurality is impressed on the entertainment. The
  principal hotel is a vast building, curiously rambling in style: the
  dining-room, for instance, is a house in itself, planted in a garden.
  Here, when the family is somewhat small and select, will be presented
  the marvels of Old Dominion cooking&#8212;the marrowy flannel-cake,
  the cellular waffle, the chicken melting in a beatitude of cream
  gravy: when the house is pressed with its hundreds of midsummer
  guests these choice individualities of kitchen chemistry are not
  attainable; but even then the bread, the roast, the coffee&#8212;a
  great <i>chef</i> is known by the quality of his simples&#8212;are of
  the true Fifth Avenue style of excellence. Captain <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 390]</span> Potts (we have come to the lands where the
  hotel-keepers are military officers), an old moustache of the Mexican
  war, broods over the large establishment like the father of a great
  family. With the men he is wise on a point of horseflesh or the
  quality of the brandy; with the matrons he is courtly, gallant,
  anecdotic: the young women appear to idolize him, and lean their
  pretty elbows on his desk half the day, for he is their protector,
  chevalier, entertainer, bonbon-holder, adviser and elder brother, all
  in one. Such is the landlord, as that rare expert is understood in
  the South. As for the regimen, it is the rarest kind of Pleasure made
  Medicinal, and that must be the reason of its efficacy. There is a
  superb pool of tepid water for the gentlemen to bathe in: a similar
  one, extremely discreet, for the ladies. Besides these, of which the
  larger is sixty feet long, there are individual baths, drinking
  fountains in arbors, sulphur and iron springs, all close to the
  hotel. The water, emerging all the year round at a temperature of
  about seventy-five degrees, remains unfrozen in winter to the
  distance of a mile or more along the rivulet by which it escapes. The
  flavor is so little nauseous that the pure issue of the spring is
  iced for ordinary table use; and this, coupled with the fact that we
  could not detect the slightest unusual taste, gave us the gravest
  doubts about the trustworthiness of this mineral fountain&#39;s old
  and unblemished reputation: another indication is, that they have
  never had the liquid analyzed. But the gouty, the rheumatic, the
  paralyzed, the dyspeptic, who draw themselves through the current,
  and let the current draw itself through them, are content with no
  such negative virtues for it, and assign</p>

  <blockquote>
    To Berkeley every virtue under heaven.
  </blockquote>

  <p>The mountain-village known to Washington as &quot;Bath&quot; is
  still a scene of fashionable revel: the over-dressed children romp,
  the old maids flirt, the youthful romancers spin in each other&#39;s
  arms to music from the band, and dowagers carefully drink at the well
  from the old-fashioned mug decorated with Poor Richard&#39;s maxims;
  but the festivities have a decorous and domestic look that would meet
  the pity of one of the regular ante-rebellion bloods. After the good
  people have retired at an early hour, we fancy the ghost of a lofty
  Virginia swell standing in the moonlight upon the piazza, which he
  decorates with gleams of phantom saliva. Attended by his teams of
  elegant horses, and surrounded by a general halo of gambling, racing,
  tourneying and cock-fighting, he seems to shake his lank hair sadly
  over the poor modern carnival, and say, &quot;Their tameness is
  shocking to me.&quot;</p>

  <p>There is a good deal of honest sport still to be had in the
  adjacent hills: the streams yield trout, and various larger prey, for
  which the favorite bait is a small ugly fish called helgamite. The
  woods contain turkeys, pheasants, quail and woodcock. The region has
  a valuable interpreter in the person of General David H. Strother, so
  agreeably known to the public as &quot;Porte Crayon,&quot; whose
  father was lessee of the Springs, and who at one period himself
  conducted the hotel. He addicts himself now to pen and pencil solely.
  In the village, where he presides over a pretty cottage home, he has
  quite a circle of idolaters: the neighbors&#39; houses display on
  their walls his sketches of the village eccentrics, attended by those
  accessories of dog or gun or nag which always stamp the likeness, and
  make the rustic critic cry out, &quot;Them&#39;s his very
  features!&quot; A large, boisterous painting in the hotel represents
  his impressions of the village arena in his youth; and ancient
  gamesters, gray-headed now, like to stroll in and contemplate their
  own portraits grouped around the cock-pit in all the hot blood of
  betting days and in the green dress-coats of 1840. Strother (now an
  active graybeard) was profoundly stirred by the outbreak of the
  rebellion. His friends were slaveholders and Confederates: he lived
  upon the mountain-line dividing the rich, proud, noble rebels of the
  eastern counties from the hungry and jealous loyalists of West
  Virginia. He himself loved the State as Bruce loved Scotland, but he
  loved country better. <span class="pagenum">[pg 391]</span> He shut
  himself up with his distracting problem for three days in utter
  privacy: he emerged with his mind made up, a Union soldier.</p>

  <p>&quot;It must have been awkward for a Virginian to cast his lot
  against Virginia,&quot; we observed to the stagedriver who bore us
  back to the station&#8212;an ex-Federal soldier and a faithful
  devotee of Crayon&#39;s.</p>

  <p>&quot;No awkwarder than for Virginia to go against her country:
  that&#39;s how <i>we</i> looked at it,&quot; retorted the
  patriot.</p>

  <p>Bidding adieu to Berkeley and its paternal landlord, we resume the
  steel road (that well-worn phrase of the &quot;iron way&quot; is a
  complete misnomer) with another glance of familiarity at the
  beautiful confluence of Sir John&#39;s Run with the Potomac, where
  the sunny waters still seem to murmur of the landing of
  Braddock&#39;s army and the novel disturbance of James Rumsey&#39;s
  steamer. The mountains extending from this point, the recesses of the
  Blue Ridge, in their general trend south-westerly through the State,
  are one great pharmacy of curative waters. Jordan and Capper Springs,
  in the neighborhood of Winchester, lie thirty or forty miles to the
  south; and beneath those are imbedded the White, Black, Yellow, and
  we know not how many other colors in the general spectrum of
  Sulphurs. It would perhaps be our duty to indicate more exactly the
  Bethesdas of this vast natural sanitarium, to which our present
  course gives us the key, but that task has already been performed, in
  a complete and very attractive manner, by Mr. Edward A. Pollard in
  his little work <i>The Virginia Tourist</i>. Our present task is to
  attain the main wall of the Alleghany Mountains, which we do at the
  town of Cumberland, after passing through the grand curved tunnel at
  Pawpaw Ridge, and crossing Little Cacapon Creek, and traversing the
  South Branch, which is the larger and true Potomac, and admiring the
  lofty precipices, with arched and vaulted strata, on South Branch
  Mountain and at Kelly&#39;s Rocks and Patterson Creek.</p><a name=

  <p>It is but a prosaic consideration, but the bracing air of the
  mountain-ride from Berkeley Springs down to the railway station, and
  the rapid career thence to Cumberland, have given us the appetites of
  ogres. We carry our pilgrim scrip into the town of Cumberland without
  much hope of having it generously filled, for this coaly capital,
  lost among its mountains, had formerly the saddest of reputations for
  hospitality. The three or four little taverns were rivals in the
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 392]</span> art of how not to diet.
  Accordingly, our surprise is equal to our satisfaction when we find
  every secret of a grand hotel perfectly understood and put in
  practice at the &quot;Queen City,&quot; the large house built and
  conducted by the railway company. A competent Chicago purveyor, Mr.
  H.M. Kinsley, who has the office of general manager of the hotels
  belonging to the corporation, resides here as at the head-quarters of
  his department, and is blessed every day by the flying guests from
  the railway-trains, as well as the permanent boarders who use
  Cumberland as a mountain-resort. The choicest dainties from the
  markets of Baltimore, laid tenderly on ice in that city and brought
  as freight in the lightning trains of the road, are cooked for the
  tables, and the traveler &quot;exercised in woes,&quot; who used to
  groan over salt pork and dreadful dodgers, now finds the
  &quot;groaning&quot; transferred to the overloaded board. The house
  is now in all the charm of freshness and cleanliness, hospitably
  furnished, with deep piazza, a pretty croquet-lawn with fountain, and
  other modern attractions, the whole surrounded with what is no small
  gain in a muddy Maryland town&#8212;a broad Schillinger cement
  pavement, which, like Mr. Wopsle&#39;s acting, may be praised as
  &quot;massive and concrete.&quot;</p>

  <p>By day, Cumberland is quite given over to carbon: drawing her
  supplies from the neighboring mining-town of Frostburg, she dedicates
  herself devoutly to coals. All day long she may be seen winding
  around her sooty neck, like an African queen, endless chains and
  trains and rosaries of black diamonds, which never tire of passing
  through the enumeration of her jeweled fingers. At night the scene is
  more beautiful. We clambered up the nearest hill at sunset, while the
  colored light was draining into the pass of Wills&#39; Mountain as
  into a vase, and the lamps of the town sprang gradually into sight
  beneath us. The surrounding theatre of mountains had a singularly
  calm and noble air, recalling the most enchanted days of Rome and the
  Campagna. The curves of the hills are marvels of swaying grace,
  depending from point to point with the elegance of draperies, and
  seating the village like a gem in the midst of &quot;great laps and
  folds of sculptor&#39;s work.&quot; The mechanics and miners, as
  twilight deepened, began to lead their sweethearts over these
  beautiful hills, so soft in outline that no paths are necessary. The
  clouds of fireflies made an effect, combining with the village lights
  below. Then as night deepened, as if they were the moving principle
  of all the enchantment, the company&#39;s rolling-mills, like
  witches&#39; kettles, began to spirt enormous gouts of flame, which
  seemed to cause their heavy roofs to flutter like the lids of
  seething caldrons.</p>

  <p>The commanding attraction of the western journey is necessarily
  the passage of the Alleghanies. The climb begins at Piedmont, and
  follows an ascent which in eleven consecutive miles presents the rare
  grade of one hundred and sixteen feet per mile. The first tableau of
  real sublimity, perhaps, occurs in following up a stream called
  Savage River. The railway, like a slender spider&#39;s thread, is
  seen hanging at an almost giddy height up the endless mountain-side,
  and curved hither and thither in such multiplied windings that
  enormous arcs of it can always be seen from the flying window of the
  car. The woods, green with June or crimson with November, clamber
  over each other&#39;s shoulders up the ascent; but as we attain the
  elevation of two hundred feet above the Savage, their tufted tops
  form a soft and mossy embroidery beneath us, diminishing in
  perspective far down the cleft of the ravine. As we turn the flank of
  the great and stolid Backbone Mountain we command the mouth of
  another stream, pouring in from the south-west: it is a
  steeply-enclosed, hill-cleaving torrent, which some lover of plays
  and cider, recollecting Shakespeare&#39;s Midsummer Night&#39;s
  slumber beneath the crabapple boughs, has named Crabtree Creek. There
  is a point where the woody gorges of both these streams can be
  commanded at once by the eye, and Nature gives us few landscape
  <i>pendants</i> more primitively wild and magnificent than
  these.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 393]</span>

  <p>This ascent was made by the engineers of the company in the early
  days of railroads, and when no one knew at what angle the friction of
  wheels upon rails would be overcome by gravity. On the trial-trip the
  railroad president kept close to the door, meaning, in the case of
  possible discomfiture and retrogression, to take to the woods! But
  all went well, and in due time was reached, as we now reach it,
  Altamont, the alpine village perched two thousand six hundred and
  twenty-six feet above the tide.</p>

  <p>The interest of the staircase we have run up depends greatly on
  its pioneer character. No mountain-chain had been crossed by a
  locomotive before the Alleghanies were outraged, as we see them, here
  and by this track. As the railroad we follow was the first to take
  existence in this country, excepting some short mining roads, so the
  grade here used was the first of equal steepness, saving on some
  English roads of inferior length and no mountainous prestige. Here
  the engineer, like Van Arnburgh in the lion&#39;s den, first planted
  his conqueror&#39;s foot upon the mane of the wilderness; and &#39;in
  this spot modern science first claimed the right to reapply that
  grand word of a French monarch, &quot;<i>Il n&#39;y a plus de
  Pyrenées</i>!&quot;</p><a name="image-0019" id="image-0019">

  <p>We are on the crest of the Alleghanies. On either side of the
  mountain-pass we have threaded rise the higher summits of the range;
  but, though we seem from the configuration of the land to be in a
  valley, we are met at every turn by the indications familiar to
  mountain-tops&#8212;indications that are not without a special
  desolation and pathos. Though all is green with summer, we can see
  that the vegetation has had a dolorous struggle for existence, and
  that the triumph of certain sparse trees here and there is but the
  survival of the strongest. They stand scattered and scraggy, like
  individual bristles on a bald pate. Their spring has been borrowed
  from summer, for the leafage here does not begin until late in June.
  The whole scenery seems to array itself for the tourist like a
  country wife, with many an incompleteness in its toilet, and with a
  kind of haggard apology for being late. Rough log-houses stand here
  and there among the laurels. The tanned gentlemen standing about look
  like California miners, as you see them in the illustrations to Bret
  Harte&#39;s stories. Through this landscape, roughly blocked out, and
  covered still with Nature&#39;s chips and shavings&#8212;and seeming
  for that very reason singularly fresh and close to her mighty
  hand&#8212;we <span class="pagenum">[pg 394]</span> fly for twenty
  miles. We are still ascending, and the true apex of our path is only
  reached at the twentieth. This was the climax which poet Willis came
  out to reach in a spirit of intense curiosity, intent to peer over
  and see what was on the other side of the mountains, and with some
  idea, as he says, of hanging his hat on the evening star. His
  disgust, as a bard, when he found that the highest point was only
  named &quot;Cranberry Summit,&quot; was sublime.</p>

  <p>&quot;Willis was particularly struck,&quot; said the landlord of
  the Glades Hotel, &quot;with a quality of whisky we had hereabouts at
  the time of his visit. In those days, before the &#39;revenue,&#39;
  an article of rich corn whisky was made in small quantities by these
  Maryland farmers. Mr. Willis found it agree with him particularly
  well, for it&#39;s as pure as water, and slips through your teeth
  like flaxseed tea. I explained to him how it gained in quality by
  being kept a few years, becoming like noble old brandy. Mr. Willis
  was fired with the idea, and took a barrel along home with him, in
  the ambitious intention of ripening it. In less than six
  months,&quot; pursued the Boniface with a humorous twinkle in his
  eyes, &quot;he sent for another barrel.&quot;</p>

  <p>The region where we now find ourselves among these mountain-tops
  is known as the Glades&#8212;a range of elevated plateaux marked with
  all the signs of a high latitude, but flat enough to be spread with
  occasional patches of discouraged farms. The streams make their way
  into the Youghiogheny, and so into the Ohio and Gulf of Mexico, for
  we have mounted the great watershed, and have long ago crossed both
  branches of the sun-seeking Potomac! We are in a region that
  particularly justifies the claim of the locomotive to be the great
  discoverer of hidden retreats, for never will you come upon a place
  more obviously disconcerted at being found out. The screams of the
  whistle day by day have inserted no modern ideas into this
  mountain-cranium, which, like Lord John Russell&#39;s, must be
  trepanned before it can be enlightened. The Glades are sacred to
  deer, bears, trout. But the fatal <span class="pagenum">[pg
  395]</span> rails guide to them an unceasing procession of staring
  citizens, and they are filled in the fine season with visitors from
  Cincinnati and Baltimore. For the comfort of these we find
  established in the Glades two dissimilar hotels.</p>

  <p>The first hostelry is the Deer Park Hotel, just finished, and
  really admirable in accommodations. It is a large and very tasteful
  structure, with the general air of a watering-place sojourn of the
  highest type&#8212;a civilized-looking fountain playing, and the
  familiar thunder of the bowling-alley forming bass to the click of
  the billiard-room. Here, as in Cumberland, we find an artificial
  forwardness of the dinner-table in the midst of the most unpromising
  circumstances. The daintiest meats and cates are served by the
  deftest waiters. The fact is, the hotel is owned by the company, and
  the dinners are wafted over, in Arabian Nights fashion, from the
  opulent markets of Baltimore. To prepare a feast, in this desolation,
  fit for the nuptials of kings and emperors, would be a very simple
  matter of the telegraph. Altogether, the aspect of this ornate,
  audacious-looking summer palace is the strangest thing, just where it
  is, to be seen on the mountains. The supreme sweetness of the air,
  the breath of pine and hemlock, the coolness of midsummer nights,
  make the retreat a boon for July and August. In autumn, among the
  resplendent and tinted mountain-scenery, with first-rate sport in
  following the Alleghany deer, the charms are perhaps greater.</p>

  <p>The other resting-place of which we spoke is at the Glades Hotel
  in the town of Oakland&#8212;the same in which Mr. Willis quenched
  his poetic thirst. Oakland, looking already old and quaint, though it
  is a creation of the railroad, sits immediately under the sky in its
  mountain, in a general dress and equipage of whitewashed wooden
  houses. A fine stone church, however, of aspiring Gothic, forms a
  contrast to the whole encampment, and seems to have been quickly
  caught up out of a wealthy city: it is a monumental tribute by the
  road-president, Mr. Garrett, to a deceased brother; the county, too,
  in its name of Garrett, bears testimony to the same powerful and
  intelligent family. As for the &quot;Glades,&quot; it is kept by Mr.
  Dailey in the grand old Southern style, and the visitor, very likely
  for the first time in his life, feels that he is <i>at home</i>. It
  is a curious thing that the sentiment of the English inn, the
  priceless and matchless feeling of comfort, has now completely left
  the mother-country to take refuge with some fine old Maryland or
  Virginia landlord, whose ideas were formed before the war. We have at
  the &quot;Glades&quot; a specimen. In Captain Potts of Berkeley we
  found another. This kind of landlord, in fact, should be a captain, a
  general or a major, in order to fill his rôle perfectly. He is the
  patron and companion of his guests, looking to their amusement with
  all the solicitude of a private householder. His manners are filled
  with a beaming, sympathetic and exquisite courtesy. He is necessarily
  a gentleman in his manners, having all his life lived that sporting,
  playful, supervisory and white-handed existence proper at once to the
  master of a plantation and the owner of a hotel. His society is
  constantly sought, his table is pounced upon by ladies with
  backgammon in the morning, by gentlemen with decks of cards at night.
  Always handsome, sunburnt, and with unaffected good-breeding, he is
  the king of his delicious realm, the beloved despot of his domain. We
  have left ourselves, in sketching the general character, no space to
  descend to particulars on Mr. Dailey; but he was all the time before
  us as a sitter when we made the portrait. A stroll with him around
  his farm, and to his limpid little chalybeate spring, after one of
  his famously-cooked, breakfasts of trout and venison, leaves an
  impression of amity that you would not take away from many private
  country-houses.</p><a name="image-0020" id="image-0020">

  <p>The affluents of the Little and Great Yok (so the Youghiogheny is
  locally called) are still stocked with trout, while a gentleman of
  Oakland has abundance of the fish artificially breeding in his
  &quot;ladders,&quot; and sells the privilege of netting them at a
  dollar the pound. As for the wild fish, we were informed by a sharp
  boy who volunteered to show us the chalybeate spring, and who guided
  us through the woods barefoot, making himself ill with
  &quot;sarvice&quot; berries as he <span class="pagenum">[pg
  396]</span> went,&#8212;we were instructed by this naturalist that
  the trout were eaten away from the streams &quot;by the
  alligators.&quot; This we regarded as a sun-myth, or some other form
  of aboriginal superstition, until we were informed by several of the
  gravest and most trustworthy gentlemen of several different
  localities on the mountains that there really is a creature infesting
  these streams supposed by them to be a young alligator, reaching a
  length of twelve inches, and doubtless subsisting on fish. An
  alligator as a mountain-reptile had not entered into our conception:
  can these voracious saurians, playing in the alpine affluents of the
  Mississippi, possibly be identical with the vast and ugly beasts of
  the lower bayous and the Gulf? We leave the identification for some
  reptile-loving philosopher.</p><a name="image-0021" id="image-0021">

  <p>Descending the western slope of the mountains, we prick up our
  attention, although the grade is gradual and easy. We know that we
  are coming to the crowning glory of the ride, the region celebrated
  for its more than Arcadian beauty, and consecrated by the earliest
  glories of our war&#8212;by the mountain Iliad of McClellan, the
  initial action at Philippi, and the prompt trampling out of West
  Virginia secession by the victories of Cheat River. This tameless,
  mountain-lapped, hemlock-tinted river had long been our fancied
  cynosure. &quot;Each mortal has his Carcassonne,&quot; said, after a
  French poet, the late lamented John R. Thompson, using the term for
  what is long desired and never attained; and Mr. Matthew Arnold, in
  writing of a &quot;French Eton,&quot; says, &quot;Whatever you miss,
  do not miss seeing Carcassonne.&quot; As Carcassonne exists in French
  landscape, exists in the tourist&#39;s mind and desire, a standard of
  beauty and historic suggestion, such to us had become this swart and
  noble river. Now it happens that Thompson has left a description, in
  his most polished prose, of glorious Cheat River. As our own powers
  of description are very inferior, we make no scruple of borrowing,
  or, as Reade calls it, &quot;jewel-setting:&quot; &quot;The grandest
  achievement of the engineer (whose name, Benjamin H. Latrobe, should

  impossible that a road-bed could ever have been built. For two miles
  beyond Rowlesburg, where the Cheat River is crossed on a massive
  bridge of iron, there is a continuous succession of marvels in
  railway-work, of which the Tray Run viaduct is a dream of lightness
  and grace, yet so firm in its welded strength that thousands of tons
  of merchandise pass over it daily without causing, the slightest
  oscillation of its airy arches. Here, too, the wonders of mechanical
  skill are placed in striking juxtaposition with the wonders of
  Nature, whose obduracy has been so signally overcome. The sense of
  security was heightened in our case by a furious storm which burst
  upon us. We were seated on the fender or&#39; cow-catcher,&#39;
  watching the majestic marshaling of the thunder-clouds over the
  mountain-tops, and enjoying to the full the excitement of the moment,
  when suddenly the wind blew a terrific gust, filling the air with
  dust and dry leaves, and threatening to carry us individually over
  the precipice. The train was stopped, and we sought shelter in the
  comfortable car, which then moved on through the driving floods that
  continued to descend for half an hour, forming cataracts on every
  side of us. But the water ran off harmlessly from the solid track,
  and our engine bade defiance to the tempest, which hurled huge
  branches of the trees into the angry abyss beneath. The triumph of
  Science over Nature was complete; and as the sinking sun threw a glow
  over the Glades where the clouds had parted, I think my companions
  caught some inspirations of the &#39;Poetry of the
  Rail-way.&#39;&quot;</p><a name="image-0022" id="image-0022">

  <p>At Grafton we have choice of two routes: one, to Wheeling, leads
  us by the beautiful scenery of the Tygart, where the Valley River
  Falls are laughing and glistening all day and all night, and by the
  stupendous Bollman bridge at Bellaire, almost two miles long, to
  Wheeling. But we continue on a straight course to Cincinnati, having
  promised ourselves to see the contrast between the City of Monuments
  and the Metropolis of Pork. Grafton offers us the accommodations of
  another of the company&#39;s hotels, where, as at Cumberland, we are
  daintily and tenderly fed. At Parkersburg we find another superb
  bridge, over a mile in length; at Athens an imposing insane asylum,
  to take care of us if all these engineering wonders have deprived us
  of our senses; and finally in Cincinnati, just a day after our
  departure from Baltimore, the gleam of the Ohio River and the
  fulfillment of our intention.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg

  <h2>AN EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF A STRONG-MINDED WOMAN.</h2>

  <center>
    <i>Extracts from a Journal</i>.
  </center>

  <p>November 1, 18&#8212;&#8212;. It is just three years to-day since
  I began to keep this journal. I am so glad now that I persisted in
  doing so, in spite of the temptations that have often assailed me to
  throw it aside. How else could I realize, bring home to myself, these
  past three years, strong and vivid as my remembrance of them is? No
  effort of mere recollection could have preserved for me as this book
  has done a record of my struggles and failures, and of my victories.
  Yes, I write the word proudly, <i>victories</i>, for I have been
  beyond my hopes successful. How well I remember my dear mother&#39;s
  distress at my queer notions, as she called them&#8212;her
  entreaties, her tender illogical protests against my making myself
  &quot;conspicuous&quot;! Dear mother! I can see now that it was very
  natural she should have disliked and dreaded my becoming a
  &quot;strong-minded woman,&quot; for anything narrower than her ideas
  of a woman&#39;s education and sphere one cannot imagine. She was an
  excellent specimen of the old-fashioned mother and wife, and I
  believe sincerely thought her whole duty in life and the intention of
  her creation was &quot;to suckle fools and chronicle small
  beer.&quot;</p>

  <p>Let me see: yes, here it is at the very beginning&#8212;November
  1, 18&#8212;&#8212;. How faded the ink looks! Let me read it:
  &quot;To-day I told mother I meant to attend a course of medical
  lectures: we had a scene, and she called in Cousin Jane to reason
  with me. How I detest Cousin Jane! She is nothing but a mass of
  orthodox dogmatism. Of course we quarreled over it, and she ended by
  telling me I was disgracing the family, and was no true woman. Well,
  we shall see which of us has the truer comprehension of a woman&#39;s
  sphere.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is three years since I wrote that. Those lectures were my first
  step, and, like all first steps, cost me more of a struggle than
  anything I have done since. As I look back over these three years, I
  see that every hope and aspiration I then cherished has been more
  than realized. I can trace the steady progress of my intellect. I can
  go back to the days when I started to earn my own living&#8212;when I
  thought it a great thing to have gained a few dollars by my own
  labor. Yes, I am very glad to have this record of the past: it makes
  me strong and hopeful of the future. I have never regretted my
  decision to make an independent life for myself. I have sought only
  to do that for which Nature had gifted me, and from which nothing but
  custom and prejudice debarred me; and in claiming my own position I
  am conscious of having helped other women, and of having led the way
  for those who may be less courageous than I am.</p>

  <p>All this might sound very conceited and self-confident to any one
  who should read it, but I do not write to be read by other eyes than
  my own: my journal is the reflex of my thoughts and feelings; so I
  may be frank with myself. And why should I <i>not</i> be proud of my
  independence, as well as any other human creature?</p>

  <p>But I must prepare my speech for to-morrow. They say they
  can&#39;t do without me, and I really believe they mean it; for
  though some women besides myself have opinions, and can put them into
  words, they mostly lack the courage that I certainly possess. What a
  delicious sense of freedom and unfettered action I have in my life! I
  don&#39;t think I have laid down the special powers of my sex in
  asserting my freedom; but you must wait, little book, for the
  confession that is on the tip of my pen. Work first: that is my
  motto.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><i>Nov</i>. 10. Ten days since I opened my journal, and such busy
  days as they have been! Three speeches, and half a pamphlet written!
  I have done what <span class="pagenum">[pg 399]</span> people
  commonly term &quot;a man&#39;s work&quot; this week. How I despise
  all these time-honored phrases, which, dead letters as they are, act
  as links to strengthen the chain that binds women in a state of
  inferiority. Why not say &quot;a <i>woman&#39;s</i> work&quot;? But
  that is a different sort of thing, I should be told: a woman should
  stay at home and take care of her house and children. Why so, say I,
  if she has no house, and does not wish for husband and children,
  feeling that they would impede her in her work? All women are not
  born to be wives and mothers: some have other work to do. But I need
  not argue with my journal: it is of my way of thinking; my ideas meet
  no opposition here. &quot;But this is not at all womanly,&quot; my
  critic would say, had I one, which I have not: &quot;you have not
  said a word of the really important event of the week.&quot; Dare I
  say that I had half forgotten it? A man has asked me to marry him!
  The great event of a woman&#39;s life has been within my reach, and I
  refused it. Mr. Whitaker is a very nice fellow, but too adoring by
  half. I want an equal, not a slave&#8212;a friend, a companion, not a
  man drawn to me by his imagination and desiring to put me on a
  pedestal before marriage, that he may reverse our position afterward.
  And then, too, marriage would hamper and restrict me. I must not give
  up to mankind what is meant for a party. But here I have a reflection
  to make, the result of my three years&#39; experience since I became
  a &quot;strong-minded woman.&quot; It is always maintained that a
  woman who chooses the life and holds the views that I do destroys her
  attraction and charm for the other sex, and that no man, however
  clever and successful she may be, will want to marry a woman who puts
  her intellect into trousers instead of petticoats. There was never a
  greater mistake. I have had four offers of marriage since I
  &quot;unsexed&quot; myself (that&#39;s the proper expression, I
  believe), and all from most respectable, well-to-do, worthy men; and
  I really think they all cared for me. I cannot help having a certain
  sense of gratified vanity about this, for, in spite of my critics, I
  am a woman still. I have earned a rest to-night, so I&#39;ll stop
  writing and go to bed.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><i>Nov</i>. 16. I feel lonely to-night. I am not often lonely:
  perhaps my little book will comfort me. Sometimes I have said to
  myself that my motto was that of a star: &quot;Einsam bin ich, nicht
  allein.&quot; To-night it is not so. That Mr. Lawrence who was
  introduced to me to-night had a striking face, but there was a sort
  of masculine manner about him that I don&#39;t fancy. Manliness I
  like, but he seemed to be so sure that I was not his equal; and yet
  he treated me with perfect respect and courtesy. Some one whispered
  in my ear, &quot;He is a great society swell.&quot; I have never seen
  anything of what is called society: I was not born with a title to
  admission within its circle, and I have always been too proud to seek
  it; yet I confess I have a curiosity to see what it is like. I
  suppose I should see the best result that the old way of looking at
  women can produce&#8212;the pink-cotton system, I call it. I
  don&#39;t believe that man would ever dream of contradicting me in a
  question of fact, or of using his strongest logical weapons against
  me in a discussion: he would only play with me mentally. How angry
  the very thought makes me! And yet he would defer to my opinion, and
  pay me all respect, and listen to everything I said, however silly,
  because I am a woman. What a strange, inconsistent mingling of
  discordant ideas! A toy and a divinity! His manners were, however,
  very agreeable: I suppose he is what is called a man of the world.
  Rather a poor thing to be: his manners are dearly bought. He said
  something about his cousin Mrs. Fordyce calling on me. Well, if she
  does, I shall perhaps have a glimpse at the <i>beau monde</i>. I
  wonder if all the men in society look as high-bred as he does? He is
  probably narrow-minded naturally, but he is one result of our scheme
  of civilization, which has its good as well as its bad points. Dear
  me! I certainly did not mean to make an analysis of Mr.
  Lawrence&#39;s character. Good-night, my little book!</p>
  <hr />

  <p><i>Nov</i>. 20. I cannot write to-night, and <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 400]</span> yet I must, I must. My head is bursting
  with thoughts and visions, my heart is swelling with new sensations.
  What an evening I have had! I shall never, never think myself
  courageous again. I, who have faced crowds with calmness, to quail
  before forty or fifty men and women, not one of whom was more
  intelligent or better educated than myself! But let me write it out
  if I can. I accepted Mrs. Fordyce&#39;s invitation to a little party.
  It was graciously given, and I, fool that I was, thought it was to do
  me honor that I was asked. I did not know then that these women of
  society will commit a baseness for a new sensation or to gratify an
  emotion of curiosity. I have been so admired, so looked up to by the
  men who have surrounded me, I never dreamed of being the object of
  mere curiosity or amusement. Well, I went. The room was half full of
  men and women, talking, laughing, moving about. I was alone, and from
  the moment of my entrance into that blaze of light I felt lonely and
  weak; but I crossed the room and spoke to my hostess. She greeted me
  graciously, and then some one else came up, and I stood aside.
  Suddenly the sense of eyes upon me came over me. How those women
  stared! Never before had I been among women and felt no bond of
  sisterhood. How was it? was I unsexed, or they? There seemed a gulf
  between us: I read it in their eyes, it came to me in the air, a
  subtle but keen conviction. And how exquisite they were!&#8212;so
  soft and smooth and white, with no lines on their foreheads or
  creases round their mouths. I had never had such a sense of beauty
  given me before by anything but pictures. I wondered the men did not
  kneel to them: I felt as if I could myself if they would let me. As I
  stood there, my heart beating quick, and something in my throat
  beginning to choke me, dazzled and bewildered by the scene, a voice
  said&#8212;oh how gently!&#8212;in my ear, &quot;Miss Linton, will
  you let me take you into the other rooms? There are one or two
  pictures you will enjoy.&quot; I tried not to start, but I trembled
  in spite of myself, the relief was so great. There we stood&#8212;he,
  Henry Lawrence, taller and handsomer and prouder-looking than any man
  in the room, looking down upon me and offering me his arm! I think I
  felt as I should if a lifeboat came to take me off a wreck&#8212;in a
  modified degree, I mean. I took his arm with a few rather
  inarticulate words of thanks, and we strolled through the other
  rooms, he listening to me with such earnest attentiveness, bending
  his head at every word, seeming so absorbed in me, so forgetful of
  the women who gazed at me as if I were a pariah, and the men who
  smiled on them as they did so. I confess it, I felt as if he stood
  between me and the mocking, coldly scrutinizing glances about me. I
  felt guarded, protected, and I could not struggle against the
  feeling, weak though I knew it was: it seemed irresistible. I
  suppose, being a woman like other women, I inherit traditional
  weakness, and cannot break the bonds of former generations in a day.
  Be it as it may, he did not seem to know or notice that I was not
  myself: he only seemed interested and absorbed. I did not feel as if
  I were taxing his courtesy, and soon I recovered my self-possession
  and talked naturally: my spirits rose, and my natural self-assertion
  returned to me. I enjoyed looking at the women, watching their ways
  and listening to the sound of their voices. It was a revelation of a
  new world to me, and I said as much to him.</p>

  <p>&quot;What in particular is it,&quot; he said, &quot;that strikes
  you so?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I think,&quot; I answered, &quot;it is the harmony of the
  whole effect.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;A thorough-bred woman always produces an harmonious
  effect,&quot; he said.</p>

  <p>Something in his tone jarred me, and I said hastily, &quot;I
  don&#39;t think development should be sacrificed to harmony:
  incompleteness is better than perfection sometimes.&quot;</p>

  <p>He smiled sweetly: &quot;Yes, but I am afraid we should hardly
  agree about the development of women, though I should like to hear
  you talk of it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why should we not discuss and
  disagree?&quot;</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 401]</span>

  <p>&quot;I do not like to disagree with a woman at all, especially
  with a woman whom I admire,&quot; he said, bending his blue eyes on
  me with a look such as I had never seen before in a man&#39;s eyes.
  It was what I suppose would be called a chivalric look; and yet
  chivalry was only an improved barbarism.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Fordyce came up just then, and introduced some gentlemen to
  me; and while they were talking Mr. Lawrence turned away. In a few
  moments he was back again with a lovely-looking young girl on his
  arm, blushing and yet self-possessed, with the same exquisite
  simplicity of manner he has himself. &quot;My cousin Alice Wilton
  asks me to introduce her to you, Miss Linton,&quot; he said.</p>

  <p>I have always&#8212;shall I confess it?&#8212;patted young girls
  on the head: this one I could no more have patronized than I could a
  statue of Diana. She was very charming to look at as she stood beside
  her cousin, and yet&#8212;No, I will make no exception: she was
  charming in every way, and I felt more at my ease that a woman had
  been presented to me.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lawrence put me in my carriage. As he closed the door he said,
  &quot;Your maid is not with you?&quot;</p>

  <p>I replied that I had none; on which he said to the driver,
  &quot;Drive slowly: I mean to walk as far as the hotel with the
  carriage.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Won&#39;t you get in?&quot; I cried from the window.</p>

  <p>He seemed not to hear me, but started off at a rapid pace, and I
  gave up the attempt, wondering at what seemed to me an eccentric
  choice. It was unnecessary for him to go with me at all, but I
  thought, &quot;He has been, I suppose, brought up to think no woman
  can take care of herself.&quot; He was ready to open the door as I
  got out, and I longed to ask him why he had not driven with me; but I
  hesitated: something tied my tongue, and in a moment he had said
  &quot;Good-night,&quot; and was gone with hasty steps into the
  darkness. I must stop, I am so tired.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><i>December</i> 3. It seems to me I am growing to be a dreadful
  egotist. I put nothing down now in this little book but just what
  concerns myself&#8212;nothing of the great subjects of universal
  interest which have always absorbed most of my thoughts, but just my
  own doings and sayings. At this very moment I desire only to write
  about my afternoon, and the way in which I spent it. I will indulge
  myself, and the record may serve me. How it had snowed all day! how
  it did snow this afternoon when I started out, wrapped in my
  waterproof, accoutred to encounter the storm, and rejoicing in the
  absence of long skirts and hooped petticoats! With my India-rubber
  boots I felt I could plod through any snow-drift, and I gained a
  pervading sense of exhilaration from the beating of the storm in my
  face. I chose a certain street I had come to know, which ran straight
  through the town and on into a more thinly-settled suburb. It was a
  good, clear path, and I should be able to have a splendid walk
  without meeting probably more than a dozen people in the course of
  it. Just as I passed the last square of closely-built town-houses,
  and began to come upon the stretching white landscape before me, as I
  trudged along, turning my head a little aside to escape the brunt of
  the driving snow, I heard an exclamation of surprise, and a man&#39;s
  voice said, &quot;You <i>here</i>, Miss Linton?&quot;</p>

  <p>It was he, Mr. Lawrence. There he stood, his eyes brilliant with
  the excitement of the storm, his cheek aglow with exercise, looking,
  as the old women say, &quot;the very picture of a man.&quot; I am
  very sensitive to beauty, and his seems to me very great: it draws me
  to him.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes it is I,&quot; I said (we had both stopped). &quot;I
  wanted exercise and air, and something to change my frame of mind; so
  I came out for a tramp.&quot;</p>

  <p>He turned with me, and we walked on. In a moment more he said,
  &quot;Will you take my arm? It will be easier to keep step and walk
  fast then.&quot;</p>

  <p>I took it, and he looked down at me and said, with an inscrutable
  smile, which haunts me yet, I suppose because <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 402]</span> I can&#39;t make out its meaning, &quot;Do
  you believe in fate?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If you mean by fate something which the will is powerless to
  resist, against which it is unavailing to struggle, I do not,&quot; I
  answered. &quot;Do you, Mr. Lawrence?&quot;</p>

  <p>He laughed, not a pleasant laugh, albeit musical, but as if his
  smile had been one with some hidden meaning in it: &quot;I hardly
  know what I believe. Certainly some power seems to lay traps for our
  wills at times, and waylay us when they are off duty. As, for
  instance,&quot; he went on, &quot;I wanted to see you to-day, and I
  did not go to see you: my will acted perfectly well, and I seemed
  able to resist any temptation. I came out here to walk alone,
  thinking that I should be even farther away from you here than
  elsewhere, when, lo! you start up in my path, and here we are
  together. It is just as if some malicious spirit had mocked me with
  an idea of my own strength, only to betray me the better through my
  weakness.&quot; He spoke with an intensity which seemed out of place,
  and strangely unlike his usual calm manner. Somehow, a feeling of
  great delight had come over me as he spoke. I felt pleased&#8212;why
  I do not know&#8212;at his evident impatience and annoyance.</p>

  <p>&quot;But why,&quot; said I, &quot;did you turn with me?
  <i>There</i> would have been the moment for your will to
  act.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You think so? That is hardly fair, Miss Linton. Does one
  brand a soldier as a coward and a laggard who has fought and won a
  battle, and has sunk exhausted upon his arms to sleep, if he is
  discomfited and dismayed when, just as slumber has him in its arms, a
  fresh foe sets upon him? No, I <i>could</i> not turn back.&quot;</p>

  <p>His eyes were bent on me again, and something in them stirred my
  soul to its depths. Such a delicious feeling seemed stealing over
  me&#8212;a feeling of mixed power and weakness. I felt my color rise,
  but I looked ahead over the snowfields and said, &quot;I don&#39;t
  see why you should have turned back. Why should you want to be with
  me and not be with me? I wanted to see you too.&quot;</p>

  <p>I started as he spoke again, for his voice and manner were both
  changed&#8212;all the quiver and intensity gone out of them.
  &quot;The &#39;reason why&#39; of a mood is hard to find sometimes,
  and when found one has a conviction that no one but one&#39;s self
  would see its reasonableness,&quot; he said with a laugh cold and
  musical. &quot;Let us talk of something we can both be sure to
  understand.&quot;</p>

  <p>He seemed far away again. For a moment he had seemed so
  near&#8212;nearer, I think, than I ever remember to have felt a man
  to be. Then he talked, and talked very well, and made me talk, though
  it was not as easy as it usually is to me, and though we spoke of
  things that are generally to me like the sound of a trumpet to the
  war-horse. My spirit did not rise: the words would hardly come. I
  wanted to be alone and think it over&#8212;think over his words, his
  manner, his voice, the look in his eyes, and see what they meant,
  and, if I could, why he had changed so suddenly to me.</p>

  <p>When we had walked some distance farther he himself proposed
  turning back, and took me home. As we neared the hotel I could not
  resist asking him why he had not come home with me that night in the
  carriage instead of walking, or running rather, beside it.</p>

  <p>Such a strange look came over his face as I asked him, and his
  lips set with a stern expression as he said stiffly, icily, &quot;I
  had realized, Miss Linton, how utterly different our ways of looking
  at life must be; or else perhaps it is that you do not hold me to be
  enough of a knight to consider a woman&#39;s position before my own
  comfort and pleasure.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t understand you,&quot; said I, bewildered.
  &quot;I <i>asked</i> you to get into the carriage.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I know it,&quot; he replied; &quot;but in such matters no
  gentleman can allow a woman&#39;s kindly impulse of courtesy to
  compromise her in any way: he must think first of her, and all the
  more because she has thought of him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What do you mean by compromise?&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;I
  am quite independent enough of public opinion to be a free agent in
  such matters: you must not <span class="pagenum">[pg 403]</span>
  forget that I am a very different woman from a society
  belle.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Quite true,&quot; he answered, stung by my tone, &quot;but I
  do not claim to be unsexed because&#8212;because&#8212;&quot; He
  stammered.</p>

  <p>&quot;Because I am? You are very right to live according to your
  lights, Mr. Lawrence, but I must decline to see life by them.
  Good-night!&quot; His tone was more than I could bear, and I turned
  abruptly from him: we had reached the hotel, and without a word more
  I ran up stairs to my parlor. The door was ajar: I entered hastily
  and pushed it to, but he had followed me on the instant, and now
  stood with it in his hand.</p>

  <p>&quot;I cannot let you send me away without saying one word,&quot;
  he said. &quot;I never meant to say that you were unsexed. I beg you
  will forgive me if I offended you. I had no right in the world to
  judge for you. It was a presumptuous impulse to protect, to guard you
  that prompted my action the other night&#8212;my words just now.
  Forgive me. As for my prejudices, they shall not displease you again:
  only remember as my excuse that a man of my class has but one way of
  looking at a woman whom&#8212;he&#8212;&quot; He drew a long breath,
  hesitated, and then said with an
  effort&#8212;&quot;admires.&quot;</p>

  <p>The word was cold and formal, but his voice and manner were warm
  and earnest. His mood seemed changed: he seemed again near me, and an
  irresistible attraction toward him possessed me, body and soul. There
  was something in his very attitude, as he stood by the door with his
  head bent down, that seemed to win me. What was it that came over me?
  What subtle power is it by which one nature draws another without any
  apparent or audible summons? I do not know; but this I know, that as
  he said the words I have just written down a floodgate within me
  seemed raised, and with a mighty rush my spirit bounded toward him.
  And yet I did not move.</p>

  <p>&quot;Forgive you?&quot; I said. &quot;Yes, a thousand
  times!&quot;</p>

  <p>He looked up, said, &quot;Thank you!&quot; very softly, and turned
  to the door. When he reached it he stopped, turned again, and came up
  to me. &quot;Will you give me your hand in token of forgiveness and
  friendship?&quot; he said.</p>

  <p>I said nothing, but held out my hand. He took it in both of his,
  and then in a moment more my arms were about his neck, and our lips
  had met. He kissed me again and again, held me very close for an
  instant, and then, untwining my arms from their hold, he abruptly
  left the room. That was three hours ago, and I have sat here
  thinking, thinking, ever since. What does it all mean? Writing it out
  has helped me, as I thought it would. Two things have become clear to
  me: I am quite conscious that I have sought Mr. Lawrence at least as
  much as he has me. I have always believed it to be as natural for a
  woman who was once freed from the foolish prejudices of education and
  tradition to hold out her hand to any one who attracted her as for a
  man to seek a woman. Now I have proved it to be true. He does attract
  me. Why deny it, either to myself or him? I do not, I will not. This
  I see and know to be true. The other thing which seems clear to me
  is, that he is only drawn by one side of his nature&#8212;that he
  does not want to love me, perhaps can only half love me. Then, if
  that be so, I have done wrong to show him my feelings. With his ideas
  about women, he would feel it to be almost unmanly to fold his arms
  on his breast if a woman put hers about his neck, as I did; and I
  fear I forced my love upon him. I feel as I should think a man feels
  who has taken an unfair advantage of a woman&#39;s fancy for him, and
  got from her graces and favors to which her whole heart does not
  assent. I am not ashamed of loving him: bear me witness, little book,
  I am not ashamed of loving him, nor indeed of telling him so; only I
  would not &quot;betray his will,&quot; as he said this afternoon. No,
  no: if he comes to me, it must be with a whole and willing heart. Now
  that&#39;s resolved, what next? Write to him of course, and tell him
  I am sorry to have led him into this position, and say, &quot;I
  won&#39;t do so again.&quot; Did a woman ever write to a <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 404]</span> man before and beg his pardon for letting
  him kiss her? for throwing her arms about his neck? I doubt it, but
  what does that matter? I belong to the new era, and I will be the
  &quot;Coming Woman.&quot; I laugh, but I feel, after all, more like
  crying. Good-night, little book. I will write to Mr. Lawrence in the
  morning. Now for bed.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><i>Dec</i>. 4. I wrote to him this morning, and sent my note by a
  messenger. I could not work, I could neither think nor write, till
  his answer came. He had made the bearer of my note wait, and wrote me
  just a few words to ask if he might not see me to-night. I wrote back
  &quot;Yes,&quot; and now it is only four o&#39;clock: he will not
  come till eight. It seems an impossible time to wait, and I must not
  waste the afternoon as I did the morning. Let me see: shall I finish
  that article on English love-poetry, past and present, in which I
  mean to show how the germ of degradation and decay always existed,
  even in the chivalric idea of woman&#39;s nature and sphere, and how
  it has gone on developing itself in the poetry which is its truest
  expression, till we have got its different stages from the ideal of
  the school which really had a gloss of elevation and fine sentiment
  about it&#8212;the woman of Herrick and Ben Jonson, and later on of
  Lovelace and Montrose, to the woman of Owen Meredith and Swinburne,
  who, instead of inspiring men to die for her honor, makes them rather
  wish her to live to be the instrument of their pleasure? It was not a
  bad idea, and I think I could have traced the gradations very well.
  But I cannot write, I cannot think. Let me recall my letter to him.
  Ah, here is one of the dozen copies I made before I could make it
  what I wanted:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;MY DEAR MR. LAWRENCE: I must ask you to forgive me, for I
    am conscious of having been thoughtless and selfish. I yielded to
    an impulse yesterday, and I put you in an unfair position. I never
    meant to do it, and I will never do it again. I trust we may be
    friends, and I am</p>

    <p>&quot;Yours truly,</p>&quot;MARGARET LINTON.&quot;
  </blockquote>

  <p>That was all I said: I wish now I had said more. Ah me! will
  evening never come?</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Before I go to bed I must write a word or two. Ah, how much
  happier I am than I was last night! He came at eight punctually. I
  trembled all over when I shook hands with him: I think he must have
  seen it, but he said nothing. What a wonderful thing this thing they
  call high breeding is! One feels it in a moment, and yet it seems
  intangible, indescribable. He has it, I should think, in perfection,
  and he is the only person I have ever known who possessed it, except,
  perhaps that young girl, his cousin, whom he presented to me at the
  party. For a while we talked&#8212;at least he did&#8212;easily and
  pleasantly, and then suddenly he said, smiling at me, &quot;Do you
  know, I think you are a very generous woman?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you? Why?&quot; said I.</p>

  <p>&quot;Because you are willing to shoulder other people&#39;s
  peccadilloes. Don&#39;t you know a woman should never do that,
  especially for a man, who is naturally selfish and can always take
  care of himself?&quot;</p>

  <p>I did not like the word <i>peccadilloes</i>, but I only said,
  &quot;So can a woman take care of herself.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you really believe that?&quot; he said with a gleam in
  his blue eyes.</p>

  <p>&quot;Really, I do. I am sure, at least, that I can take care of
  myself.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Are you?&quot; said he. We were sitting beside each other on
  the sofa, and in another moment he had put his arm about me and drawn
  me to him. I could not resist him&#8212;his voice, his eyes, his
  sweet words. I loved him and was happy. It was a heaven of delight to
  be so near him; and how natural it seemed! He said little, nor did I
  speak many words: he held me in his arms, kissed me many times on my
  hands, cheeks and lips; and then suddenly, almost abruptly, he left
  me, pleading an engagement. But my happiness did not go with him. I
  am happy in the conviction that he loves me, and I feel strong to
  make him all my own. He will come again to-morrow. He did not say so:
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 405]</span> no need to say so&#8212;he will
  surely come. He is poor, I know. What of that? I earn a good income,
  and together we can defy the world. I shall be able to convert him
  from his prejudices and narrow notions, now that he loves me. What an
  acquisition to our cause! He loves me as I am. I have yielded
  nothing, I have sacrificed nothing&#8212;not one iota of principle,
  not an inch of ground. He has come to me because he loves me. I can
  influence him to think as I do of woman&#39;s nature and sphere. My
  single life will convince him of the justice of my ideas, and having
  known me, he can never &quot;decline on a lower range of feelings and
  a narrower sphere than mine.&quot;</p>

  <p>I am triumphant, I am successful: I could sing a song of
  rejoicing. Have I not always felt sure that a woman&#39;s true
  attraction does not depend on the false attitude in which she is
  placed by men? This man has seen me as I am, and I have drawn him to
  me.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><i>Dec</i>. 11. It seems scarcely possible that it is but one week
  since I wrote those words above, yet the date stares me in the face,
  and tells me that but seven days and seven nights have passed since
  then. It seems to me as if all my past life held less of emotion, of
  sensation, less of <i>living</i>, than this one week; and what
  absolute, uncompromising pain it has all been! It seems to me as if I
  had been through every stage of suffering in succession; yet to what
  does it all amount? what has caused it all? what has racked me with
  all these various gradations of torture? Just this: since that night,
  that triumphant, happy night, I have neither heard from nor seen Mr.
  Lawrence. Silence, unbroken silence, has been between us. I have
  borne it, but oh how badly!&#8212;not calmly or with quiet
  self-control and strength; but I have borne it with passionate
  out-cry and restless struggles. I have sobbed myself to sleep at
  night: I have roamed aimlessly about during the day, or lain on a
  lounge, book in hand, pretending to read, but in reality listening,
  waiting, longing to hear his step, his knock, to have some message,
  some sign, come to me from him. Then it has seemed to me as if there
  was but one other human creature in the world, and that was
  he&#8212;as if all the manifold needs and wants, losses and gains, of
  humanity had no longer the slightest meaning for me. I have no sense
  of any ambition, any aim, any obligation pressing upon me. I find
  nothing within myself to feed upon but a few pale memories of him,
  and my whole future seems concentred in his existence. I do not think
  I can bear to live as I am now. It is all profoundly dark to me. Why
  does he not come? I can think of no possible explanation&#8212;none.
  I am resolved to think it out to an end, and then act: it is this
  passiveness which is killing me.</p>

  <p>I am resolved: I will write, and will ask him to come to me, and
  when he comes I will say what I feel. Some mistaken hesitation is
  keeping him away. I will say, &quot;We love one another: let us unite
  our lives and live them together, yoked in all exercise of noble
  end.&quot;</p>

    <i>Letter from Henry Lawrence to George Manning</i>.
  </center>

  <blockquote>
    DECEMBER 11.

    <p>DEAR GEORGE: I will begin by telling the truth, and here it is:
    I am in a scrape. I know you won&#39;t think much of the simple
    fact, but the scrape is very different from any of my former ones,
    and I don&#39;t see how I can get out of it honorably. I can see
    you raise your eyebrows, and hear you say with an incredulous
    smile, &quot;Why, Harry, I have heard you ridicule honor a thousand
    times where women are concerned, and of course this scrape involves
    a woman.&quot; You are right there&#8212;it does; or rather a woman
    has involved me, and there lies the scrape. As for honor, I laugh
    at most of the things I believe in, just because it&#39;s the
    fashion of the day&#8212;and I belong to the day I live
    in&#8212;<i>not</i> to wear one&#39;s heart on one&#39;s sleeve.
    Then, too, sometimes one finds that logically one thinks a thing,
    an idea, a feeling absurd, and yet when one&#39;s life comes into
    collision with it, somehow up springs something within you which I
    suppose might be called an instinct, and forces you to respect and
    <span class="pagenum">[pg 406]</span> cherish and uphold the very
    feeling or idea which you have always ridiculed.</p>

    <p>Well, I&#39;ll tell you my story, and then perhaps you&#39;ll
    tell me what to do. About&#8212;let me see&#8212;a month ago I went
    with some men one evening, out of pure idleness, to a public
    meeting. The men who spoke were all stupid, and roared and mouthed
    stuff &quot;full of sound and fury, signifying nothing,&quot; and I
    was thinking how I could get away and have a game of cards at the
    club, when suddenly a voice like music smote upon my astonished
    ears. I looked up, and there on the platform stood a woman,
    speaking, by Jove! and doing it well, too. I listened and looked,
    and should have enjoyed it if it had not disgusted me so in theory.
    I must confess, barring the fact of her being there, there was
    nothing objectionable about her. She was handsome, and had a
    magnificent voice: she talked a hundred per cent, better than the
    men who preceded her; and it was well for the meeting that it was
    over when she stopped: any other speaker would have made a terrible
    anti-climax. The two fellows with me proposed our being introduced
    to her, and half from curiosity, half&#8212;I swore to speak the
    truth&#8212;half, George, from attraction (hear me out, old fellow:
    she was feminine-looking and very handsome)&#8212;I went forward
    and was presented. She interested and attracted me, the more so
    perhaps that from the moment our eyes met I was conscious that
    there existed between us a strong natural affinity, latent, but
    capable of being developed. I called on her the next day, and made
    my cousin Clara invite her to a party. Clara, who is thoroughly
    unconventional, and would do anything to please me, did so without
    a second thought. But imagine my distress when, as I entered the
    drawing-room a little late, I saw my fair Amazon standing in a
    doorway, not only alone, but alone in the midst of curious and
    scornful glances. My courtesy was at stake, my chivalry was roused,
    and she looked very handsome and very like any other woman brought
    to bay. She had the most charming expression, compounded of
    bewilderment and defiance, on her face when my eyes fell on her,
    and it changed to one that pleased me still better (which I
    won&#39;t describe) when our eyes met. You, you unbelieving dog,
    think that because she is &quot;strong-minded&quot; she must be
    repulsive and immodest. But there is a charming inconsistency about
    female human nature.</p>

    <p>But to go on with my story. I felt quite like a champion, I
    assure you, for, after all, it was shabby of the women to give her
    the cold shoulder, and cowardly of the men to stand aloof; so I
    devoted myself to her, and asked Alice Wilton to be presented to
    her. Miss Linton has not a particle of <i>usage du monde</i>, nor
    is she what would be called high-bred; but she is self-possessed
    and gentle in her manner, and makes a good enough figure in the
    company of ladies and gentlemen. Here I confess my weakness. I did
    think her very attractive, and I was conscious that I had a power
    over her which I did not forbear to exercise. The result of this
    was that when we parted she had every reason to expect to see me
    very soon again, and I had inwardly resolved never to see her again
    if I could help it. I did keep away, and then luck would have it
    that I met her taking a walk one snowy afternoon. I suspected she
    had come out to get away from the remembrance of me, as I had to
    get away from the desire to see her; and she was so moved by seeing
    me that I could not help showing her that I cared for her, and
    perhaps seemed to care more than I did. It was a sore temptation,
    and I yielded to it. Wrong? Do you think I don&#39;t know that it
    was wrong? But the worst is to come. I walked back with her, and an
    accident led to our having one of those conversations that people
    have when they are under the influence of emotion and cannot give
    it vent in its natural way, but must do something or talk. If I
    could have put my arms about her and kissed her, we could have got
    on without words: as it was, I said I hardly know what, and she,
    being very much in earnest and very unsophisticated, showed me how
    much she cared for me. I vow, George, if I had had a moment to
    think, to gather my self-control&#8212;But <span class=
    "pagenum">[pg 407]</span> I had not, and so we ended by my finding
    her arms round my neck, after all. I rushed away with hardly a
    word, and walked and walked, and thought and thought. The next day
    comes a note from her&#8212;what one would call a manly,
    straightforward acknowledgment that she had led me into a position
    that was an unfair one, and that she regretted it. Nothing franker
    or more generous could have been conceived, but somehow it roused
    within me the impulse to make her conscious of the weakness of her
    sex. My masculine conceit rose and demanded an opportunity of
    self-assertion. I went to her, and she seemed more attractive than
    ever. Her independence and self-reliance nettled me, and I was mean
    enough to yield to the desire to see if she could resist me. But I
    was richly punished, for the knowledge rolled over me like a wave
    that she loved me, and I left her, stung by the consciousness of
    having taken an unworthy advantage of a simple and trustful nature.
    I know that this is high tragedy, and will meet with your
    displeasure. I can hear you say, &quot;Confound you, Harry! why
    don&#39;t you marry her?&quot;</p>

    <p>Very easy to say; but look at the situation, which is not so
    simple as you probably think. Of course any girl of my own class
    would never build an edifice of eternal and sacred happiness on
    such a foundation as a few warm looks and eloquent words, or even a
    caress, might furnish. In plain words, neither she nor I would
    think marriage a necessary or even likely sequence to such a
    preamble. But it is different with Miss Linton. I am sure, I am
    confident&#8212;laugh if you like&#8212;that she has never given
    any man what she has given me, either in degree or kind. Her
    eccentric notions about women&#39;s nature and position would
    protect her from tampering with her own feelings or those of
    another; and then, too, there has been so much hard reality, so
    much serious business, in her life that the sweet follies of
    girlhood have not been hers. Shall I say that I cannot help feeling
    her innocence and inexperience make her more attractive? I am not
    sure, even, that they do not balance her self-reliance and
    independence, which certainly repel me. All this I did not dream of
    at first. I am not a scoundrel or a coxcomb. It came to me the
    other afternoon all at once, when she threw her arms about my neck.
    I have been selfish, and perhaps stupid. &quot;Why not marry
    her?&quot; you say. I have asked myself that question, and this is
    my answer: No passion in the world could make me insensible to the
    humiliation of her career, and I should be obliged not only to
    accept it in the past, but to recognize it in the future. My wife
    must be my social equal and the natural associate of high-bred
    women. I must be able to take any man by the throat who looks at or
    speaks of her as does not please me. This woman&#39;s character,
    intellect, manners and appearance are public property for all
    purposes of criticism and comment. She is unsexed. My wife must be
    dependent on me, clinging to me. This woman has always stood, and
    will always stand alone; and yet I have thought that she was
    capable of such deep, strong, concentrated feeling that the man who
    owned her heart might do with her as he liked. This, I admit, has
    tempted me to think of marriage, for, after all, George, it would
    be a luxury to be very much loved. This woman would love a man in
    another fashion from that which prevails in society.</p>

    <p>But I have put the idea away from me, and here I am, determined
    not to marry her, and yet feeling that I have unintentionally
    wronged her. I have not been near her these seven days. I know she
    expects me&#8212;she has every right to expect me&#8212;but I will
    not go till I have decided what to say and do. I am too weak to go
    otherwise. Write to me, George, and advise me; and remember that
    she is not like the women of whom we have both known so many. She
    has no more idea of flirting than had Hippolyta queen of the
    Amazons or Zenobia queen of Palmyra&#8212;those two strong-minded
    women of old days. I am joking, but I assure you I am not jolly. I
    am afraid, George, that she truly loves me, and, unsexed though she
    <span class="pagenum">[pg 408]</span> be, love has made a woman of
    her, and I fear is unmanning me.</p>Yours always, HENRY LAWRENCE.

    <p>P.S. I open my letter to say that it is too late for you to
    write when you receive this: it will be over. I have just got a
    note from her asking to see me. I shall speak frankly, but I feel
    like a hound. As ever, H.L.</p>

    <i>Journal</i>.
  </center>

  <p><i>Dec</i>. 11. I am resolved to write it all down as it happened.
  I wrote him a note this afternoon, and this evening he
  came&#8212;handsome, pale and quiet. He walked up to me, took my hand
  in his, pressed it and let it go. He did not wait for me to speak,
  fortunately, for I could not have spoken: I could not have commanded
  my voice. He said&#8212;oh so quietly and steadily!&#8212;&quot;I
  should have come to see you to-night, I think, if you had not asked
  me: I had so much to say.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I thought you would never come,&quot; I answered.</p>

  <p>He rose and walked hurriedly up and down the room, then paused in
  front of me and said&#8212;his words seem burned into my
  brain&#8212;&quot;You are a woman who deserves frankness, and I will
  be utterly and absolutely frank with you. I have done very wrong in
  behaving as I have done. I had no right, no justification, for it,
  and I beg you to forgive me&#8212;humbly I beg it on my knees;&quot;
  and he knelt before me.</p>

  <p>I was bewildered and pained beyond measure. I thought I knew not
  what, but a tissue of wild absurdities rushed through my brain to
  account for his words&#8212;anything rather than think he did not
  love me.</p>

  <p>&quot;With many women this confession would be unnecessary,&quot;
  he went on. &quot;You are genuine and simple, and attach a real
  meaning to every word and act, because you do not yourself speak or
  act without meaning. How can I, then, part from you without asking
  your forgiveness for what I have said and done?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Part from me!&quot; I exclaimed, holding out my hands to
  him: he had risen now. &quot;Oh, Mr. Lawrence, let us be frank with
  one another. There is no need to part. Do you think your poverty is
  any barrier between us? It is but an added bond. Can I not work too?
  And we will learn to think alike where we now differ. Why should we
  part? We love each other. Why should we not marry? What can part us
  but our own wills? I love you, you know it, and I think you love me;
  at least I am sure I could teach you to love me.&quot; He stood while
  I spoke, his arms hanging by his sides. What more I said I hardly
  know. I think&#8212;I am sure, indeed&#8212;I told him, standing
  there, how I loved him. I felt I must speak it once to one human
  being. A great foresight came to me: I seemed to see my life
  stretching before me, long, lonely, desolate: no other love like this
  could come, full well I knew that, and I could not enter on that
  dreary path without setting free my soul. Yes, I spoke out to him.
  Words of power they were&#8212;power and fire and longing. Perhaps I
  alone, of all women, have told a man of my love when I knew it to be
  hopeless. My hope had died when he first spoke. Had he loved me, he
  had spoken otherwise. That I was woman enough to see; but if it be
  unwomanly to feel in every pulse-throb the need of expression, to
  know that I should die of suppressed passion, tenderness, love, if I
  did not speak it all, did not tell him once how I loved him, how I
  could have lived his servant, his slave, happy and content&#8212;how
  his smile seemed the sun and his caresses heaven to me&#8212;how I
  was hungry with the hunger of my very soul to spend on him the
  garnered treasure of my heart,&#8212;if this be unwomanly, I was
  indeed unsexed. I seemed exalted out of myself, and full of
  power.</p>

  <p>He heard me, and it moved him. He spoke again when I had finished.
  He had not lifted his eyes to mine, and did not then. He said,
  &quot;I could not marry you: it would be the worst possible thing for
  both of us. Your life would be miserable&#8212;mine most wretched.
  You must see that there are other things in life besides love, and
  other things which <span class="pagenum">[pg 409]</span> influence
  its happiness. Everything would separate us except our personal
  affinity. Our education, our ideas, beliefs, our past lives, our aims
  for the future, make a gulf between us. We could never bridge
  it,&quot; He paused.</p>

  <p>I laughed aloud: he looked at me then in surprise. &quot;I
  laugh,&quot; said I, &quot;because I see how absurd it was to fancy
  that you loved me. A bridge between us! If you loved me as I love
  you, our love would turn water into land, melt mountains into plains:
  we would cross dry-shod to one another.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you love me so?&quot; he said, his blue eyes gleaming,
  and making a step toward me. I had power enough to make him feel, and
  feel strongly, but that was not enough.</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;Mr. Lawrence, you must take nothing
  from me now: I can give nothing now.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But if I want all?&quot; he said.</p>

  <p>I laughed again. &quot;But you do not,&quot; I said. &quot;I have
  told you I love you and would marry you. You cannot, you say. Then
  that ends all between us. I love you too much to be able to give you
  only what you give me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;We cannot marry,&quot; he repeated: &quot;it would be ruin
  to both of us.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Go away!&quot; I said: &quot;I would rather be alone.&quot;
  I was spent, and felt feeble and weak.</p>

  <p>&quot;Let me tell you, first, that I admire you, esteem you,
  infinitely: let me say this before I go; and you will think of me
  kindly.&quot; He said this pleadingly.</p>

  <p>I looked at him wonderingly. Did he not <i>yet</i> know how much I
  loved him? My courage and pride were ebbing fast away. Faintly I
  said, &quot;Before you go kneel down in front of me, and let me touch
  your forehead with my lips.&quot; He did so, and I bent forward and
  took his head in both my hands and kissed it. Somehow as I did it the
  strange thought came to me that if I had ever had a son, just so I
  have kissed his head. It was a yearning feeling, with such tenderness
  in it that my heart seemed dissolving. Many times. I kissed it and
  held it, and then, &quot;Good-bye, my only love,&quot; I said.
  &quot;I could have loved you very well.&quot;</p>

  <p>His eyes were wet with tears as he raised his head. &quot;I shall
  never forget you: you are nobleness itself,&quot; he said. &quot;God
  bless and prosper you, Miss Linton!&quot; Then he went.</p>

  <p>That is all, all, and life is where it was a month ago; only,
  &quot;I wear my rue with a difference.&quot; He was my inferior. I
  was higher and nobler and purer than he, but I loved him, and the
  greatest joy I could know would have been to lead my life with him.
  So it is over, and this book had best be put away. I will go back to
  my old life, and see what I can make of it. I am glad to have known
  what love meant: I shall be gladder after a while, when this ache is
  over. If he could but have loved me as I loved him&#8212;if he could!
  But he could not, and it was not to be. I must learn to be again a
  strong-minded woman.</p><br />

  <h2>THE KING OF BAVARIA.</h2>

  <p>Of all the prominent personages who, through their official
  position or individual power, or both combined, occupy at present the
  eye of the public, probably not one is more unjustly criticised or
  more generally misunderstood than Ludwig II., king of Bavaria. As a
  reigning monarch, young, handsome, secluded in his habits and
  unmarried, he is of course exposed to all the inquisitive observation
  and exaggerated gossip which the feminine curiosity and masculine
  envy of a court and capital can supply&#8212;gossip which is eagerly
  listened to by the annual crowd of foreigners who spend a few days in
  Munich to visit the Pinakothek, listen to a Wagner opera, and catch,
  if possible, a glimpse of the romantic young king; and is by them
  carried home to find public circulation at third hand through the
  columns of sensation newspapers. And when to this personal criticism
  is added the strife of opinion over his political acts, and the
  ill-will of the extreme Church party in consequence of his liberal
  tendencies, it may easily be believed that his real character is but
  little known, and is in many cases deliberately falsified. A brief
  review of the facts and circumstances of his reign may serve to
  correct, in some degree, the false impressions which have so long
  prevailed.</p>

  <p>In 1864, in the midst of the confusion of the Schleswig-Holstein
  war, which was then agitating all Germany, King Max died, and his
  eldest son, Ludwig, only nineteen years old, was summoned from the
  quiet routine of his university studies to ascend the throne of
  Bavaria. In childhood his health had been extremely delicate, and on
  that account he had been educated in unusual privacy&#8212;training
  which, joined to his naturally reserved and meditative disposition,
  and the various disenchantments of his public career, may
  satisfactorily account for his present confirmed love of solitude.
  The position to which he was so unexpectedly called was an
  exceedingly difficult one for a mind filled, as his was, with ideal
  visions of liberty and progress, and totally inexperienced in the
  ways of a selfish world and in the profundity of Jesuitical
  intrigues; and the unavoidable embarrassments of the time had been
  increased by the course of his immediate predecessors. Ludwig I.,
  through a sentimental love of the picturesque, had encouraged the
  multiplication of monasteries and convents and brotherhoods of
  wandering friars, and Maximilian, though naturally tolerant, and
  still more liberalized by the influence of his Protestant queen, was
  a firm believer in the divine right of kings; and having joined hands
  with the clerical party in putting down the revolution of 1848, found
  himself afterward so far compromised in their behalf that he was
  unable to oppose their aggrandizing plans; so that in his reign the
  priests, and especially the Jesuits, attained to a greater degree of
  power than they had ever before known.</p>

  <p>The young king for a while carried on the government after his
  father&#39;s policy, and with the same ministerial officers; but he
  soon began to show signs of independence of character, the first
  manifestation of which was an attempt to curtail the power of the
  Jesuits, especially in the matter of public instruction. This was, of
  course, enough to rouse the enmity of the whole Society of Jesus
  against him, and its members have been busy ever since in thwarting
  all his plans and doing their utmost to render him unpopular with his
  subjects.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the king soon gave his people a plausible excuse
  for fault-finding by the unbounded favor which he bestowed upon
  Wagner, whose ideas and whose music were at that time alike obnoxious
  to the majority of Germans. The favorite theory of this great genius,
  but arrogant and unscrupulous man, was the elevation of the German
  nation through the aesthetic and moral influence of a properly
  developed theatre; and <span class="pagenum">[pg 411]</span> the king
  was ready to offer every facility for the practical realization of
  this visionary plan. But the Jesuits scented heresy in the alliance
  between the experienced composer and the youthful dreamer, and the
  liberal party were indignant that Wagner&#39;s affairs should be made
  a cabinet question at a time of such great national anxiety. The
  dissatisfaction rose to such a height at last that it became
  necessary for Wagner to leave Munich, and for his royal patron to
  break off, apparently at least, the unpopular intimacy. The people
  were right, to some extent, in denouncing Wagner, whose course in
  Munich, as elsewhere, had been selfish and ungrateful, and in blaming
  the king for indulging his individual tastes to the neglect of his
  duties as a ruler; but the youth and inexperience of the latter were
  a sufficient excuse for excess of enthusiasm, and reproach may well
  be forgotten in astonishment and admiration at the capacity of this
  mere boy to understand and feel those wonderful musical dramas which
  were then almost universally laughed at or condemned, though their
  gradual but steady rise in public appreciation seems now to warrant
  their claim to be considered as &quot;the music of the
  future.&quot;</p>

  <p>In December, 1865, a little more than a year after his accession,
  King Ludwig acknowledged the union of Italy under Victor
  Emmanuel&#8212;an important step, which at once arrayed the Catholic
  Church against him as its enemy. He also endeavored to effect a
  reconciliation between Vienna and Berlin, but his mediation did not
  avail; nor could he hinder the alliance of Bavaria with Austria in
  the war of 1866. But as soon as peace was concluded he quitted the
  policy of his father, which he had hitherto, for the most part,
  followed, and selected as members of his cabinet men of liberal
  principles and progressive ideas, calling to, its head Prince
  Hohenlohe, a known friend of Prussia and a firm opposer of the
  Austrian alliance.</p>

  <p>One of the first projects of the new ministry was to free the
  public schools, as far as possible, from the influence of the clergy.
  These and other liberal movements aroused the whole force of the
  Ultramontane party, and a terrible strife ensued, resulting in
  Hohenlohe&#39;s resignation, which the king was unwillingly obliged
  to accept. Hohenlohe was succeeded by Count Bray, a man devoted to
  feudalism and the Church, who had been minister under Ludwig I. and
  Maximilian II. The clerical party were exultant in their triumph.
  They saw that trouble was brewing between France and Prussia, and
  trusted that Count Bray would be able to prevent any alliance between
  the latter state and Bavaria. They would have preferred a coalition
  with France and Austria against Prussia and the kingdom of Italy,
  with the ultimate purpose of reinstating the pope as a temporal
  sovereign. To this end they were willing to degrade Bavaria to a
  province of Rome, and would gladly have dethroned the king if they
  could have done so; their hatred of him having been increased in the
  mean time by his public recognition of Dr. Döllinger&#39;s protest
  against the decree of papal infallibility. But when the crisis came
  their hopes were speedily frustrated by the king&#39;s prompt
  decision to stand by Prussia in the contest. He at once declared his
  intention to Parliament, which had until then appeared willing to
  grant only the supplies necessary to maintain Bavaria in a state of
  armed neutrality. The decision was the king&#39;s
  alone&#8212;&quot;<i>My word is sacred</i>&quot; was his principle of
  action&#8212;but after he had taken the first step his ministers
  supported him throughout the struggle with patriotic zeal. He
  immediately issued a proclamation calling his people to arms against
  their hereditary enemy, and his message, &quot;<i>We South Germans
  are with you</i>&quot; was the first pledge of sympathy and
  assistance that cheered the king and the citizens at Berlin.</p>

  <p>King Ludwig&#39;s conduct in this matter is especially deserving
  of praise, because his kingdom is of sufficient size and importance
  to make its absorption into the empire a great sacrifice of
  individual pride; particularly when it is remembered that Prussia, of
  which Bavaria had <span class="pagenum">[pg 412]</span> long been
  jealous, was to be the leading power in the new union of states, and
  Prussia&#39;s king the emperor. But from the time of Ludwig&#39;s
  accession he had looked forward with hope to a consolidation of the
  numerous states of Germany into one nation; and the opportunity,
  though coming sooner than he or any one else had anticipated, found
  him not unprepared for the change. When the storm against Hohenlohe
  was at its height, he said, &quot;Does that party really think that
  the steps which have already been taken toward the unity of Germany
  will be retracted? Then they do not know me. I have not read Schiller
  in vain. I too can say, &#39;All the power, all the influence, which
  belongs to me as a constitutional prince I will lay in the scale of
  the idea of the unity of Germany.&#39; I should greatly prefer to
  devote myself to peaceful pursuits, to clear the way for my people to
  elevate themselves through education and material prosperity, and to
  help them open the noble treasure of ideas bequeathed to them by our
  thinkers and poets; but when a foreign enemy is standing at
  Germany&#39;s gates I hold it my duty not only to give my army, my
  lands and my property for the public good, but to offer myself to the
  commander in-chief as a common soldier of the united German
  empire.&quot; On another occasion he said, &quot;I acknowledge in my
  country only one party&#8212;that of truly noble men, who, through
  extensive knowledge, pure thoughts and useful deeds, serve the
  commonwealth, whether these be skillful workmen, citizens, peasants,
  scholars, honest magistrates, who, like myself, serve the people
  conscientiously, officers who are friends as well as leaders of the
  soldiers, worthy priests of all confessions, who are real physicians
  of souls, righteous judges, teachers of my people, or noblemen who
  add to the distinction of title that of true nobility of soul, and
  set a worthy example in all good things: all these, and only these,
  are of my party.&quot;</p>

  <p>And again: &quot;I desire of my Creator not the satisfaction of
  gratified ambition, but the joy of knowing that after my death it
  will be said of me, &#39;Ludwig II. strove to be a true friend to his
  people, and he succeeded in making them happier.&quot; And again:
  &quot;It would gratify me more to obtain a true solution of my
  country&#39;s social problems than to become, by force of arms, ruler
  of all Europe; nor should I be willing to incur the responsibility of
  a single life lost through my pursuit of any selfish plan.&quot;</p>

  <p>These quotations are sufficient to show the enlightened views of
  the king in regard to his duties as a ruler; and his whole conduct
  since his accession has proved his desire to free his subjects from
  the chains of bigotry and superstition in which they have so long
  been bound. His constant opposition to the machinations of the
  Jesuits, his increasing neglect of the religious shows and ceremonies
  in which Munich delights, and his open support of Döllinger and the
  liberal Catholics, indicate plainly enough that he is no slave of the
  Church of which he is by birth and training a member; but his example
  and influence cannot, as yet, effect much against the strong majority
  of Ultramontanists in Parliament and the crowds of priests who still
  hold spiritual sway over the greater portion of his people. One
  peculiar hindrance to the success of any progressive measure in
  Bavaria lies in the absurd regulation which makes every ex-cabinet
  minister a member of a separate government council, the consent of
  which must be obtained before any new royal or parliamentary decree
  can be put in force; and as the majority of these ex-ministers are
  Ultramontanists or otherwise behind the times, it will be seen that
  the progressive party, though with the king at their head, are
  constantly thwarted by this auxiliary force of the Jesuits and old
  fogies outside the government.</p>

  <p>With regard to the private life of the king, his secluded habits
  are a source of general complaint. The Bavarians, and especially the
  citizens of Munich, would like him to mix freely with his people in
  the streets and at places of public resort, as Ludwig I. was in the
  habit of doing, and to settle down with wife and children around him,
  after the manner of <span class="pagenum">[pg 413]</span> good King
  Max; to head all their festive processions, preside at the opening of
  their annual fairs, and lend himself to legendary customs which have
  long lost their significance, and to social gayeties in which he can
  find no pleasure. And because he refuses to take his airings in the
  crowded streets, to head the processions on Corpus Christi and St.
  John&#39;s Day, to wash the disciples&#39; feet on Holy Thursday, to
  preside at the Michaelmas horse-races and puppet-shows, and to marry
  for the sake of increasing the brilliancy of the court and
  perpetuating the Wittelsbach dynasty, he is denounced alike by
  devotees and worldlings, who judge him, not by what he does that is
  good and useful, but by what he does not do to gratify them. Because
  he spends the greater part of the year in retirement at his castles
  in the country, coming to Munich only for the session of Parliament
  in the winter, he is accused of indifference to the prosperity of his
  state and the welfare of his subjects.</p>

  <p>But he himself says, &quot;It is incumbent upon a prince to
  meditate upon the duties of his calling, which he can surely do
  better when alone with God and Nature than in the confusion of a
  court.&quot; His ministers and all who have occasion to approach him
  in a business capacity declare that at every such interview they are
  surprised at his thorough knowledge of the subject under discussion,
  as also at his keen insight into character and motives.</p>

  <p>To an unprejudiced observer&#8212;say to an intelligent foreigner
  who remains in Bavaria long enough, not only to hear all the gossip,
  but to see and judge for himself as to the merits of the
  case&#8212;the career of this young king is exceedingly interesting
  and worthy of admiration. It is something, in these times of
  political intrigue and diplomatic evasion, that a king can say,
  &quot;My word is sacred,&quot; without awakening in any mind a
  remembrance of broken faith and forgotten obligations. It is
  something, amid the corruptions of a dissolute capital and the
  temptations of a royal court, that the sovereign, young, full of
  tender sentiment, and unprotected by the marriage tie, lives on with
  virtue unimpeached; not even the bitterest enemy daring to breathe a
  word against the purity of this modern Lohengrin. It is something
  that a man born to the splendors of a throne should prefer to these
  the simplicity of Nature, the solitude of woods and mountains, the
  companionship of music that searches the soul&#39;s sincerity, and of
  books that have no recognition of royalty in their announcement of
  immortal and universal truths.</p>

  <p>In the endless criticism of which the king is the subject
  attention is often called, sometimes in pity, sometimes in blame, to
  the fact that he has no intimate friend or friends. Those who make
  this reproach forget that his station demands a certain degree of
  isolation, unless he would lay himself open to the charge of
  favoritism, and the object of his preference to the flatteries and
  manoeuvrings of the parasites that infest a court. Of the men of his
  own age whose rank would entitle them to associate with the king on
  terms of familiarity, there is not one who has sufficient sympathy
  with his tastes and pursuits to be chosen by him as a companion; and
  the tyranny of etiquette and custom forbids him to seek out a
  congenial friend from among the untitled scholars and thinkers who
  judge him tenderly and justly from afar. Moreover, his early
  unfortunate essays in this direction may well have taught him to be
  reserved and cautious in be-stowing his confidence and love. The man
  whose splendid genius enthralled, and still enthralls, the intellect
  of the king had not the moral qualities to secure his esteem; the
  woman whose beauty once took his senses captive he soon found to be
  unworthy of his heart; and disappointments such as these are a lesson
  for a lifetime to a character such as his.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he has abundant resources within himself for the
  entertainment of his self-chosen solitude. The education which was so
  early interrupted by a summons to the throne has been continued with
  zeal through the study of the best authors in various languages. He
  always has some favorite work at hand for the <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 414]</span> edification of a chance mood or unoccupied
  moment; and in his frequent short journeys, however slight provision
  he may make for his wardrobe, a port-manteau well filled with books
  is sure to accompany him. When in the country a good portion of his
  time is spent on horseback. With a single attendant at some distance
  behind him, he rides for hours, stopping occasionally at some
  peasant&#39;s cottage or roadside inn to refresh himself with a glass
  of water or a simple meal, treating his temporary entertainers the
  while with an unreserved friendliness which has won him the devoted
  affection of his lowly neighbors, and which he never displays within
  the precincts of the court.</p>

  <p>The king&#39;s favorite residence is Hohenschwangau, where he is
  building a noble castle upon the site of a ruin which was originally
  a Roman fortress and afterward a feudal stronghold. The new building
  is modeled after the style of the Wartburg, and is composed of
  various kinds of stone brought from different parts of Germany and
  Switzerland, and selected for their beauty and durability. The work
  has been in progress for about two years, and will probably require
  ten or twelve years more to finish it, as the season for outdoor
  labor in that mountainous region is necessarily short.. The
  surrounding scenery is magnificent: lakes, mountains, gorges,
  waterfalls, gloomy forests, sunny meadows, all that is grand and
  beautiful in Nature, are here comprised within a single view.</p>

  <p>The present castle stands on the spur of an adjacent hill, and
  commands the same extensive prospect. Though of moderate size (too
  small, indeed, to accommodate at the same time the king and the
  queen-mother with their respective suites, for which reason it is
  occupied by each only during the absence of the other), the
  appearance of the castle is imposing, and its interior decorations
  render it a most interesting point for the tourist, as well as a
  delightful residence for its proprietors. The walls of all the
  principal apartments are adorned with frescoes painted by some of the
  best German artists, each room being devoted to a special subject.
  There is the &quot;Hall of the Swan-Knight,&quot; containing
  illustrations of that most charming legend, the foundation of the
  world&#39;s best opera, <i>Lohengrin</i>; the &quot;Schwangau
  Chamber,&quot; with pictures concerning the history of the locality;
  the &quot;Bertha Chamber,&quot; containing the story of the parents
  of Charlemagne; the &quot;Ladies&#39; Chamber,&quot; portraying the
  life of German women in the Middle Ages, the principal figure being a
  portrait of Agnes, wife of Otto von Wittelsbach, an ancestor of the
  royal house; the &quot;Hall of Heroes,&quot; containing illustrations
  of the Vilkina Saga, Dietrich of Berne being supposed to have lived
  at Hohenschwangau; the &quot;Knights&#39; Chamber,&quot; representing
  the knightly customs of the Middle Ages; the &quot;Oriental
  Chamber,&quot; with frescoes recalling King Maximilian&#39;s travels
  in the East; and several other rooms, in each of which is
  commemorated some striking point of German history or some
  interesting record of national manners. The furniture of all these
  apartments is rich and tasteful; and scattered here and there are
  little indications of home-life which lend a new charm to the stately
  abode. Thus, upon a table loaded with costly and beautiful objects
  are two exquisite portraits, on porcelain, of the king and his
  brother, suggesting at once the usual vicinity of their affectionate
  mother; while the abundance of books in the king&#39;s private
  sitting-room is a pleasant reminder of his studious habits. It is
  curious to see how the swan, the device of this ancient property,
  which was formerly called &quot;Schwanstein&quot;, is represented in
  every possible manner and material in the adornment of the castle.
  Swans are pictured upon the armorial bearings at the entrance-gate; a
  bronze swan spouts water from its uplifted beak in the garden
  fountain; while below, upon the two lakes that enclose the park,
  groups of living swans are floating about, as if to testify to the
  abiding characteristics of the place. Within the building not only is
  the swan a prominent figure in the frescoed story, but whichever way
  one turns one sees a counterfeit presentment of the graceful
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 415]</span> bird. There is Lohengrin in his
  enchanted boat impelled by his beloved swan, an exquisite group in
  silver, and another like it in porcelain; swans are carved upon the
  furniture, moulded upon the dishes, painted upon cups and saucers,
  embroidered upon cushions and footstools: they serve as ornaments to
  antique goblets, as covers to match-boxes, as handles to vases. The
  paper-knife upon His Majesty&#39;s writing-table is carved into the
  same likeness, and swans adorn the top of the pen-handle and preside
  over the ink and sand bottles.</p>

  <p>Besides the castle of Hohenschwangau, the king has a hunting-lodge
  at Linderhof, which is being fitted up with great elegance in the
  Renaissance style, and a palace on Lake Starnberg, where he spends
  the greater part of his time, its nearness to Munich making it a
  convenient residence.</p>

  <p>As a consolation for the severities of winter and the utter lack
  of beauty in the situation and surroundings of Munich, he has his
  winter-garden, that mysterious enclosure at the top of the palace,
  which is a perpetual irritant to the curiosity of the public, who
  grudge to their ruler every token of that possession of his which he
  seems to value above all the rest&#8212;his privacy. Now and then
  some noted scholar or privileged acquaintance is invited to enter
  this green retreat, so that its delights are not all unknown to the
  outside world. The garden opens from the private apartments of the
  king, and encloses a space of two hundred and thirty-four feet in
  length by fifty (in one part ninety) feet in breadth, being, in fact,
  the upper story of the west wing of the palace, with a raised and
  vaulted roof of iron and glass. The landscape is arranged after the
  king&#39;s own idea, and is entirely Oriental in vegetation and
  effect, the long perspective of tropical luxuriance being closed by a
  distant view of the Himalaya Mountains, so admirably executed that
  the illusion is not dispelled until the beholder approaches very near
  to the wall upon which it is painted. The garden is agreeably
  diversified by groups of palms, plantains and other trees, by open
  lawns adorned with beds of brilliant flowers, and by sheltered walks
  and secluded arbors. A considerable space is occupied by a lake
  bordered with reeds, the home of several swans, which float up and
  down in the dreamy silence: a little way from the shore stands a
  small pavilion entirely hidden in the dense shrubbery that surrounds
  it; and farther off a gorgeous <i>kiosk</i> raises its glittering
  cupolas and slender minarets above the neighboring bushes and
  blossoming plants.</p>

  <p>During the king&#39;s stay in Munich in the winter he takes but
  little part in the gayeties of the season. He conforms, indeed, to
  the customs of a court in giving the stated number of balls, dinners
  and concerts; but it is easy to see that necessity, and not
  inclination, prompts him to the task. There is plenty of work to
  occupy his mind during the session of Parliament, and books enough to
  read and ponder over in the solitude of his chamber; and so long as
  he is alert and well prepared on every question of business to which
  his attention is called, affable and polite to persons with whom he
  is brought into official contact, gentle and generous to the poor and
  oppressed who appeal to him in person&#8212;and no one can deny that
  he is all this&#8212;why should he be blamed for preferring to spend
  his time as</p>

  <blockquote>
    A being breathing thoughtful breath,
  </blockquote>

  <p>instead of making himself a gazing-stock for the curious and a
  companion of the gay and the foolish of his generation?</p>

  <p>It may be that in the far-off future, long after the titles and
  prerogatives of royalty shall have been done away with and wellnigh
  forgotten, the virtues of this king, who is so poorly appreciated by
  his contemporaries, will be commemorated in some beautiful legend,
  like that of his favorite story of the Swan-Knight; since even now,
  when that chaste hero appears in the dazzling purity of his enchanted
  armor upon the Munich stage, one turns involuntarily to recognize his
  counterpart in the solitary occupant of the royal box.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

  <p>Lenox again, and bluebirds darting to and fro among the maples. I
  had reached the hotel at midnight. Our train was late, detained on
  the road, and though my thoughts drove instantly to the Sloman
  cottage, I allowed the tardier coach-horses to set me down at the
  hotel. I had not telegraphed from New York. I would give her no
  chance to withhold herself from me, or to avoid me by running away.
  There was no time for her, as yet, to have read of the ship&#39;s
  arrival. I would take her unawares.</p>

  <p>So, after the bountiful Nora, who presides over the comfort of her
  favorites, had plied me with breakfast-cakes and milk and honey, I
  sauntered down toward the Lebanon road. Yes, sauntered, for I felt
  that a great crisis in my life was at hand, and at such times a
  wonderful calmness, almost to lethargy, possesses me. I went slowly
  up the hill. The church-clock was striking nine&#8212;calm, peaceful
  strokes. There was no tremor in them, no warning of what was coming.
  The air was very still, and I stopped a moment to watch the bluebirds
  before I turned into the Lebanon road.</p>

  <p>There was the little gray cottage, with its last year&#39;s vines
  about it, a withered spray here and there waving feebly as the soft
  April air caught it and tossed it to and fro. No sign of life about
  the cottage&#8212;doors and windows tight shut and barred. Only the
  little gate swung open, but that might have been the wind. I stepped
  up on the porch. No sound save the echo of my steps and the knocking
  of my heart. I rang the bell. It pealed violently, but there were no
  answering sounds: nothing stirred.</p>

  <p>I rang again, more gently, and waited, looking along the little
  path to the gate. There was snow, the winter&#39;s snow, lingering
  about the roots of the old elm, the one elm tree that overhung the
  cottage. Last winter&#39;s snow lying there, and of the people who
  had lived in the house, and made it warm and bright, not a footprint,
  not a trace!</p>

  <p>Again I rang, and this time I heard footsteps coming round the
  corner of the house. I sat down on the rustic bench by the door. If
  it had been Bessie&#39;s self, I could not have stirred, I was so
  chilled, so awed by the blank silence. A brown sun-bonnet,
  surmounting a tall, gaunt figure, came in sight.</p>

  <p>&quot;What is it?&quot; asked the owner of the sun-bonnet in a
  quick, sharp voice that seemed the prelude to &quot;Don&#39;t want
  any.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Where are Mrs. Sloman and Miss Stewart? Are they not in
  Lenox?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Miss&#39; Sloman, she&#39;s away to Minnarsoter: ben
  thar&#39; all winter for her health. She don&#39;t cal&#39;late to be
  home afore June.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And Miss Stewart?&#8212;is she with her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Miss Stewart? I dunno,&quot; said the woman, with a strange
  look about the corners of her mouth. &quot;I dunno: I never see her;
  and the family was all away afore I came here to take charge. They
  left the kitchen-end open for me; and my
  sister-in-law&#8212;that&#39;s Hiram Splinter&#39;s wife&#8212;she
  made all the &#39;rangements. But I <i>did</i> hear,&quot; hesitating
  a moment, &quot;as how Bessie Stewart was away to Shaker Village; and
  some does say &quot;&#8212;a portentous pause and clearing of her
  throat&#8212;&quot;that she&#39;s jined.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Joined</i>&#8212;what?&quot; I asked, all in a mist of
  impatience and perplexity.</p>

  <p>&quot;Jined the Shakers.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; I said, recovering my breath angrily.
  &quot;Where is this Hiram&#39;s wife? Let me see her.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In the back lot&#8212;there where you see the yaller house
  where the chimney&#39;s smoking. That&#39;s Hiram&#39;s house. He has
  charge of the Gold property on the hill. <span class="pagenum">[pg
  417]</span> Won&#39;t you come in and warm yourself by the fire in
  the kitchen? I was away to the next neighbor&#39;s, and I was sure I
  hear our bell a-ringin&#39;. Did you hev&#39; to ring long?&quot;</p>

  <p>But I was away, striding over the cabbage-patch and climbing the
  worm-fence that shut in the estate of Hiram. Some wretched mistake:
  the woman does not know what she&#39;s talking about. These
  Splinters! they seem to have had some communication with Mrs. Sloman:
  they will know.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Splinter, a neat, bright-eyed woman of about twenty-five,
  opened the door at my somewhat peremptory knock. I recollected her in
  a moment as a familiar face&#8212;some laundress or auxiliary of the
  Sloman family in some way; and she seemed to recognize me as well:
  &quot;Why! it&#39;s Mr. Munro! Walk in, sir, and sit down,&quot;
  dusting off a chair with her apron as she spoke.</p>

  <p>&quot;Miss Stewart&#8212;where is she? <i>You</i> know.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Miss Stewart?&quot; said the woman, sinking down into a
  chair and looking greatly disturbed. &quot;Miss Stewart&#39;s gone to
  live with the Shakers. My husband drove her over with his
  team&#8212;her and her trunk.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, where was her aunt? Did Mrs. Sloman know? Why isn&#39;t
  Miss Bessie with her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Miss&#39; Sloman said all she could&#8212;<i>afterward</i> I
  guess,&quot; said the woman, wiping her eyes, &quot;but
  &#39;twan&#39;t no use then. You see, Miss&#39; Sloman had jined a
  party that was goin&#39; to Minnesota&#8212;while she was in
  Philadelfy, that was&#8212;and Miss Stewart she wasn&#39;t goin&#39;.
  She reckoned she&#39;d spend the winter here in the house. Miss&#39;
  Sloman&#39;s maid&#8212;that&#39;s Mary&#8212;was goin&#39; with her
  to the West, and I was to hire my sister-in-law to take charge of
  things here, so that Miss Bessie could have her mind free-like to
  come and go. But afore ever Mary Jane&#8212;that&#39;s my
  sister-in-law&#8212;could come over from Lee, where she was
  livin&#39; out, Miss Bessie comes up and opens the house. She stayed
  there about a week, and she had lots of company while she was here. I
  think she got tired. They was people that was just goin&#39; to sail
  for Europe, and as soon as they went she just shut up and told me to
  send for Mary Jane to take care of things. So Mary Jane never see
  her, and perhaps she giv&#39; you a crooked answer, sir, if you was
  inquirin&#39; of her over to the cottage.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Where&#39;s Hiram? where&#39;s your husband? Can I have his
  team this morning?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I guess so,&quot; said the sympathetic Mrs. Splinter.
  &quot;He&#39;ll show you the very house he druv&#39; her
  to.&quot;</p>

  <p>Hiram was hunted for and found; and an hour later I was bowling
  along the Lebanon road behind the bay team he was so proud of. I had
  concluded to take him&#39; with me, as he could identify places and
  people, and I knew well what castles the Shaker houses are for the
  world&#39;s people outside. Hiram was full of talk going over. He
  seemed to have been bottling it up, and I was the first auditor for
  his wrath. &quot;I know &#39;m,&quot; he said, cracking his whip over
  his horses&#39; heads. &quot;They be sharp at a bargain, they be. If
  they&#39;ve contrived to get a hold on Bessie Stewart, property and
  all, it&#39;ll go hard on &#39;em to give her up.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;A <i>hold</i> on Bessie!&quot; What dreadful words! I bade
  him sharply hold his tongue and mind his horses, but he went on
  muttering in an undertone, &quot;Yo&#39;ll see, yo&#39;ll see!
  You&#39;re druv&#39; pretty hard, young man, I expect, so I won&#39;t
  think nothing of your ha&#39;sh words, and we&#39;ll get her out, for
  all Elder Nebson.&quot;</p>

  <p>So Hiram, looked out along the road from under his huge fur-cap,
  and up hill and down. The miles shortened, until at last the fair
  houses and barns of the Shaker village came in sight. A sleeping
  village, one would have thought. Nobody in the road save one old man,
  who eyed us suspiciously through the back of a chair he was
  carrying.</p>

  <p>&quot;It must be dinner-time, I think,&quot; said Hiram as he
  drove cautiously along. Stopping at a house near the bridge:
  &quot;Now this is the very house. Just you go right up and knock at
  that &#39;ere door.&quot;</p>

  <p>I knocked. In a twinkling the door <span class="pagenum">[pg
  418]</span> was opened by a neat Shaker sister, whose round, smiling
  face was flushed, as though she had just come from cooking dinner. I
  stepped across the threshold: &quot;Bessie Stewart is here. Please
  say to her that a friend&#8212;a friend from England&#8212;wishes to
  see her.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said the motherly-faced woman, for she was sweet
  and motherly in spite of her Shaker garb, &quot;I&#39;ll go and
  see.&quot;</p>

  <p>Smilingly she ushered me into a room at the left of the hall.
  &quot;Take seat, please;&quot; and with a cheerful alacrity she
  departed, closing the door gently behind her.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well,&quot; thought I, &quot;this is pleasant: no bolts or
  bars here. I&#39;m sure of one friend at court.&quot;</p>

  <p>I had leisure to observe the apartment&#8212;the neatly-scrubbed
  floor, with one narrow cot bed against the wall, a tall bureau on
  which some brown old books were lying, and the little dust-pan and
  dust-brush on a brass nail in the corner. There was a brightly
  polished stove with no fire in it, and some straight-backed chairs of
  yellow wood stood round the room. An open door into a large, roomy
  closet showed various garments of men&#39;s apparel hanging upon the
  wall. The plain thermometer in the window casement seemed the one
  article of luxury or ornament in the apartment. I believe I made my
  observations on all these things aloud, concluding with, &quot;Oh,
  Bessie! Bessie! you shall not stay here.&quot; I know that I was
  startled enough by the apparition of a man standing in the open
  closet door. He must have been within it at my entrance, and had
  heard all I said.</p>

  <p>He came forward, holding out his hand&#8212;very friendly
  apparently. Then, requesting me to be seated, he drew out a chair
  from the wall and sat down, tilting it back on two legs and leaning
  against the wall, with his hands folded before him. Some commonplace
  remark about the weather, which I answered, led to a rambling
  conversation, in which he expressed the greatest curiosity as to
  worldly matters, and asked several purely local questions about the
  city of New York. Perhaps his ignorance was feigned. I do not know,
  but I found myself relating, <i>à la</i> Stanley-Livingstone, some of
  the current events of the day. His face was quite intelligent, tanned
  with labor in the fields, and his brown eyes were kind and soft, like
  those of some dumb animals. I note his eyes here especially, as
  different in expression from those of others of his sect.</p>

  <p>Several times during the conversation I heard footsteps in the
  hall, and darted from my seat, and finally, in my impatience, began
  to pace the floor. Kindly as he looked, I did not wish to question
  the man about Bessie. I would rely upon the beaming portress, whose
  &quot;<i>Sure</i>&quot; was such an earnest of her good-will.
  Moreover, a feeling of contempt, growing out of pity, was taking
  possession of me. This man, in what did he differ from the Catholic
  priest save in the utter selfishness of his creed? Beside the sordid
  accumulation of gain to which his life was devoted the priest&#39;s
  mission among crowded alleys and fever-stricken lanes seemed luminous
  and grand. A moral suicide, with no redeeming feature. The barns
  bursting with fatness, the comfortable houses, gain added to
  gain&#8212;to what end? I was beginning to give very short answers
  indeed to his questions, and was already meditating a foray through
  the rest of the house, when the door opened slowly and a lady-abbess
  entered. She was stiff and stately, with the most formal neckerchief
  folded precisely over her straitened bust, a clear-muslin cap
  concealing her hair, and her face, stony, blue-eyed and cold&#8212;a
  pale, frozen woman standing stately there.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bessie Stewart?&quot; said I. &quot;She is here&#8212;I know
  it. Do not detain her. I must see her. Why all this delay?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Dost thou mean Sister Eliza?&quot; she asked in chilling
  tones.</p>

  <p>&quot;No, nobody&#39;s sister&#8212;least of all a sister
  here&#8212;but the young lady who came over here from Lenox two
  months ago&#8212;Bessie Stewart, Mrs. Sloman&#39;s niece.&quot; (I
  knew that Mrs. Sloman was quite familiar with some of the
  Shakeresses, and visited them at times.)</p><span class="pagenum">[pg
  419]</span>

  <p>Very composedly the sister took a chair and folded her hands
  across her outspread handkerchief before she spoke again. I noticed
  at this moment that her dress was just the color of her eyes, a pale,
  stony blue.</p>

  <p>&quot;Sister Eliza: it is the same,&quot; in measured accents.
  &quot;She is not here: she has gone&#8212;to Watervliet.&quot;</p>

  <p>Can this be treachery? I thought, and is she still in the house?
  Will they hide from her that I am here? But there was no fathoming
  the woman&#39;s cold blue eyes.</p>

  <p>&quot;To Watervliet?&quot; I inquired dismally. &quot;How? when?
  how did she go?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;She went in one of our wagons: Sister Leah and Brother
  Ephraim went along.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;When will they return?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I cannot say.&quot;</p>

  <p>All this time the man was leaning back against the wall, but
  uttered not a word. A glance of triumph shot from the sister&#39;s
  eyes as I rose. But she was mistaken if she thought I was going away.
  I stepped to the window, and throwing it open called to Hiram, who
  was still sitting in his wagon, chewing composedly a bit of straw. He
  leaped out in an instant, and leaning out to him I rapidly repeated
  in an undertone the previous conversation: &quot;What would you
  do?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ten chances to one it&#39;s a lie. Tell &#39;em you&#39;ll
  set there till you see her. They can&#39;t shake us off that
  way.&quot;</p>

  <p>I drew in my head. The pair still sat as before. &quot;Well,&quot;
  said I, &quot;as I <i>must</i> see her, and as you seem so uncertain
  about it, I will wait here.&quot;</p>

  <p>And again I took my seat. The sister&#39;s face flushed. I had
  meant no rudeness in my tone, but she must have detected the
  suspicion in it. She crimsoned to her temples, and said hastily,
  &quot;It is impossible for us to entertain strangers to-day. A
  brother is dying in the house: we are all waiting for him to pass
  away from moment to moment. We can submit to no intrusion.&quot;</p>

  <p>Well, perhaps it was an intrusion. It was certainly their house if
  it did hold my darling. I looked at her steadily: &quot;Are you sure
  that Bessie Stewart has gone away from here?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;To Watervliet&#8212;yea,&quot; she answered composedly.
  &quot;She left here last week.&quot;</p>

  <p>My skill at cross-examination was at fault. If that woman was
  lying, she would be a premium witness. &quot;I should be sorry,
  madam,&quot; I said, recalling the world&#39;s etiquette, which I had
  half forgotten, &quot;to intrude upon you at this or any other time,
  but I cannot leave here in doubt. Will you oblige me by stating the
  exact hour and day at which Miss Stewart is expected to return from
  Watervliet, and the road thither?&quot;</p>

  <p>She glanced across the room. Answering the look, the man spoke,
  for the first time since she had entered: &quot;The party, I believe,
  will be home to-night.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And she with them?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yea, unless she has elected to remain.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;At what hour?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I cannot tell.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;By what road shall I meet her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;There are two roads: we generally use the
  river-road.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;To-night? I will go to meet her. By the river-road, you
  say?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yea.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And if I do not meet her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If thou dost not meet her,&quot; said the lady-abbess,
  answering calmly, &quot;it will be because she is detained on the
  road.&quot;</p>

  <p>I had to believe her, and yet I was very skeptical. As I walked
  out of the door the man was at my heels. He followed me out on to the
  wooden stoop and nodded to Hiram.</p>

  <p>&quot;Who is that, Hiram?&quot; I whispered as he leaned across
  the back of a horse, adjusting some leathern buckle.</p>

  <p>&quot;That?&quot; said Hiram under his breath. &quot;That&#39;s a
  deep &#39;un: that&#39;s Elder Nebson.&quot;</p>

  <p>Great was the dissatisfaction of the stout-hearted Splinter at my
  retreat, as he called it, from the enemy&#39;s ground.</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;d ha&#39; liked nothin&#39; better than to beat up
  them quarters. I thought every minit&#39; you&#39;d be calling me,
  and was ready to go in.&quot; And he clenched his fist in a way that
  showed unmistakably how he would have &quot;gone in&quot; had he
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 420]</span> been summoned. By this time we
  were driving on briskly toward the river-road. &quot;You
  wa&#39;n&#39;t smart, I reckon, to leave that there house. It was
  your one chance, hevin&#39; got in. Ten chances to one she&#39;s hid
  away som&#39;eres in one of them upper rooms,&quot; and he pointed to
  a row of dormer-windows, &quot;not knowin&#39; nothin&#39; of your
  bein&#39; there.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Stop!&quot; I said with one foot on the shafts. &quot;You
  don&#39;t mean to say she is shut up there?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Shet up? No: they be too smart for that. But there&#39;s
  plenty ways to shet a young gal&#39;s eyes an&#39; ears &#39;thout
  lockin&#39; of her up. How&#39;d she know who was in this wagon, even
  if she seed it from her winders? To be sure, I made myself
  conspicuous enough, a-whistlin&#39; &#39;Tramp, tramp,&#39; and
  makin&#39; the horses switch round a good deal. But, like enough, ef
  she&#39;d be down-spereted-like, she&#39;d never go near the winder,
  but just set there, a-stitchin&#39; beads on velvet or a-plattin&#39;
  them mats.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why should she work?&quot; I asked, with my grasp still on
  the reins.</p>

  <p>&quot;Them all does,&quot; he answered, taking a fresh bite of the
  straw. &quot;It&#39;s the best cure for sorrow, they say. Or mebbe
  she&#39;s a-teachin&#39; the children. I see a powerful sight of
  children comin&#39; along while you was in there talkin&#39;,
  a-goin&#39; to their school, and I tried to ask some o&#39; them
  about her. But the old sheep who was drivin&#39; on &#39;em looked at
  me like vinegar, and I thought I&#39;d better shet up, or mebbe
  she&#39;d give the alarm that we was here with horses and wagon to
  carry her off.&quot;</p>

  <p>I had a painful moment of indecision as Hiram paused in his
  narrative and leisurely proceeded to evict a fly from the near
  horse&#39;s ear. &quot;I think we&#39;ll go on, Hiram,&quot; I said,
  jumping back to my seat again. &quot;Take the river-road.&quot;</p>

  <p>Hiram had brought plentiful provision for his horses in a bag
  under the seat. &quot;Victualed for a march or a siege,&quot; he said
  as he dragged out a tin kettle from the same receptacle when we drew
  up by the roadside an hour after. &quot;We&#39;re clear of them
  pryin&#39; Shakers, and we&#39;ll just rest a spell.&quot;</p>

  <p>I could not demur, though my impatience was urging me on faster
  than his hungry horses could go.</p>

  <p>&quot;I told Susan,&quot; he said, &quot;to put me up a bit of pie
  and cheese&#8212;mebbe we wouldn&#39;t be back afore night. Won&#39;t
  you hev&#39; some?&#8212;there&#39;s a plenty.&quot;</p>

  <p>But I declined the luncheon, and while he munched away
  contentedly, and while the horses crunched their corn, I got out and
  walked on, telling Hiram to follow at his leisure. My heart beat fast
  as I espied a wagon in the distance with one&#8212;yes,
  two&#8212;Shaker bonnets in it. Bessie in masquerade! Perhaps
  so&#8212;it could not be the other: that would be too horrible. But
  she was coming, surely coming, and the cold prim sister had told the
  truth, after all.</p>

  <p>The wagon came nearer. In it were two weather-beaten dames,
  neither of whom could possibly be mistaken for Bessie in disguise;
  and the lank, long-haired brother who was driving them looked
  ignorant as a child of anything save the management of his horses. I
  hailed them, and the wagon drew up at the side of the road.</p>

  <p>It was the women who answered in shrill, piping voices: &quot;Ben
  to Watervliet? Nay, they&#39;d ben driving round the country, selling
  garden seeds.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Did they know Bessie Stewart, who was staying in the Shaker
  village, in the house by the bridge?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Sure, there had ben a stranger woman come there some time
  ago: they could not tell&#8212;never heerd her name.&quot;</p>

  <p>I was forced to let them drive on after I had exhausted every
  possible inquiry, trusting that Hiram, who was close behind, would
  have keener wit in questioning them, but Hiram, as it happened, did
  not come up to them at all. They must have turned off into some
  farm-house lane before they passed him. The afternoon wore on. It
  grew toward sunset, and still we kept the river-road. There was no
  trace of the Shaker wagon, and indeed the road was growing wild and
  lonely.</p>

  <p>&quot;I tell you what,&quot; said Hiram, stopping suddenly,
  &quot;these beasts can&#39;t go on for ever, and then turn round and
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 421]</span> come back again. I&#39;ll turn
  here, and drive to the little tavern we passed about two mile back,
  and stable &#39;em, and then you and me can watch the road.&quot;</p>

  <p>It was but reasonable, and I had to assent, though to turn back
  seemed an evil omen, and to carry me away from Bessie. The horses
  were stabled, and I meanwhile paced the broad open sweep in front of
  the tavern, across which the lights were shining. Hiram improved the
  opportunity to eat a hearty supper, urging me to partake. But as I
  declined, in my impatience, to take my eyes off the road, he brought
  me out a bowl of some hot fluid and something on a plate, which I got
  through with quickly enough, for the cool evening air had sharpened
  my appetite. I rested the bowl on the broad bench beside the door,
  while Hiram went backward and forward with the supplies.</p>

  <p>&quot;Now,&quot; said he as I finished at last, still keeping my
  eye upon the road, &quot;you go in and take a turn lyin&#39; down:
  I&#39;ll watch the road. I&#39;m a-goin&#39; to see this thing
  out.&quot;</p>

  <p>But I was not ready to sleep yet; so, yielding to my injunction,
  he went in, and I seated myself, wrapped in a buffalo robe from the
  wagon. The night was damp and chill.</p>

  <p>&quot;Hedn&#39;t you better set at the window?&quot; said the
  kind-hearted landlady, bustling out. Hiram had evidently told her the
  story.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh no, thank you;&quot; for I was impatient of walls and
  tongues, and wanted to be alone with my anxiety.</p>

  <p>What madness was this in Bessie? She could not, oh she could not,
  have thrown her life away! What grief and disquiet must have driven
  her into this refuge! Poor little soul, scorched and racked by
  distrust and doubt! if she could not trust me, whom should she
  trust?</p>

  <p>The household noises ceased one by one; the clump of willows by
  the river grew darker and darker; the stars came out and shone with
  that magnetic brilliancy that fixes our gaze upon them, leading one
  to speculate on their influence, and&#8212;</p>

  <p>A hand on my shoulder: Hiram with a lantern turned full upon my
  face. &quot;&#39;Most one o&#39;clock,&quot; he said, rubbing his
  eyes sleepily. &quot;Come to take my turn. Have you seen
  nothing?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; I said, staggering to my feet, which felt
  like lead&#8212;&quot;nothing.&quot;</p>

  <p>I did not confess it, but to this hour I cannot tell whether I had
  been nodding for one minute or ten. I kept my own counsel as I turned
  over the watch to Hiram, but a suspicion shot through me that perhaps
  that wagon had gone by, after all, in the moment that I had been off
  guard.</p>

  <p>Hiram kept the watch faithfully till five that morning, when I too
  was stirring. One or two teams had passed, but no Shaker wagon
  rattling through the night. We breakfasted in the little room that
  overlooked the road. Outside, at the pump, a lounging hostler, who
  had been bribed to keep a sharp lookout for a Shaker wagon, whistled
  and waited too.</p>

  <p>&quot;Tell you what,&quot; said Hiram, bolting a goodly rouleau of
  ham and eggs, &quot;I&#39;ve got an idee. You and me might
  shilly-shally here on this road all day, and what surety shall we
  hev&#39; that they hevn&#39;t gone by the other road. Old gal said
  there was two?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, but the folks here say that the other is a wild
  mountain-road, and not much used.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, you see they comes down by the boat a piece, or they
  <i>may</i> cut across the river at Greenbush. They have queer ways.
  Now, mebbe they <i>have</i> come over that mountain-road in the
  night, while you and me was a-watchin&#39; this like ferrits. In that
  case she&#39;s safe and sound at Shaker Village, not knowin&#39;
  anything of your coming; and Elder Nebson and that other is
  laughin&#39; in their sleeves at us.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Perhaps so.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Now, this is my advice, but I&#39;ll do just as you say.
  &#39;Tain&#39;t no good to lay around and watch that ere house <i>to
  day</i>. Ef we hedn&#39;t been in such a white heat, we might just
  hev&#39; hid round in the neighborhood <i>there</i> till she came
  along. But it&#39;s too late, for that now. Let&#39;s you
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 422]</span> and me lay low till Sunday.
  She&#39;ll be sure to go to meetin&#39; on Sunday ef she&#39;s there,
  and you can quietly slip in and see if she is. And to shut their eyes
  up, so that they won&#39;t suspect nothin&#39;, we&#39;ll leave a
  message on one of your pasteboards that you&#39;re very sorry not to
  hev&#39; seen her, drefful sorry, but that you can&#39;t wait no
  longer, and you are off. They&#39;ll think you&#39;re off for York:
  you&#39;ve got York on your cards, hevn&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You just come and stay to my house: we&#39;ll make you
  comfortable, and there&#39;s only one day longer to wait. This is
  Friday, be&#39;ent it? You&#39;d best not be seen around to the
  hotel, lest any of their spies be about. They do a powerful sight
  o&#39; drivin&#39; round the country this time o&#39; year. And then,
  you see, ef on Sunday she isn&#39;t there, you can go over to
  Watervliet, or we&#39;ll search them houses&#8212;whichever you
  choose.&quot;</p>

  <p>There seemed no help for it but to take Hiram&#39;s advice. We
  drove homeward through the Shaker village, and drew up at the house
  again. This time the door was opened by a bent, sharp little Creole,
  as I took her to be: the beaming portress of the day before had been
  relieved at her post.</p>

  <p>&quot;Nay, Bessie Stewart was not at home: she would go and
  inquire for me when she was expected.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; I said carelessly, not wishing to repeat the scene
  of yesterday and to present myself, a humiliated failure, before the
  two elders again&#8212;&quot;no: give her this card when she does
  come, and tell her I could stay no longer.&quot;</p>

  <p>I had not written any message on the card, for the message,
  indeed, was not for Bessie, but for the others. She would interpret
  it that I was in the neighborhood, anxious and waiting: she would
  understand.</p>

  <p>&quot;Home, then, Hiram,&quot; as I took my seat beside him.
  &quot;We&#39;ll wait till Sunday.&quot;</p><a name="churchstepschxi"

  <h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

  <p>&quot;You&#39;d better eat sum&#39;thin&#39;,&quot; said Hiram
  over the breakfast-table on Sunday morning. &quot;Got a good long
  drive afore you, and mebbe a good day&#39;s work besides. No? Well,
  then, Susan, you put the apple-brandy into the basket, and some of
  them rusks, for I reckon we&#39;ll hev&#39; work with this young man
  afore night.&quot;</p>

  <p>Susan, bless her good heart! wanted to go along, and as
  Hiram&#39;s excitement was evidently at the highest pitch, he
  consented that she should occupy the back seat of the wagon:
  &quot;P&#39;raps Miss Stewart&#39;ll feel more comfortable about
  leavin&#39; when she sees there&#39;s a woman along.&quot;</p>

  <p>It was a rainy morning, and there were but few wagons on the road.
  Arrived at the village, we encountered one little procession after
  another of broadbrim straws and Shaker bonnets turning out of the
  several houses as we drove past. They stepped along quickly, and
  seemed to take no notice of us.</p>

  <p>&quot;Reckon we&#39;re the only visitors to-day,&quot; whispered
  Hiram as he stopped at the horseblock in front of the meeting-house.
  &quot;You know where you hev&#39; to set&#8212;on the left-hand side;
  and Susan, she goes to the right.&quot;</p>

  <p>I followed Susan up the steps, and she hastened, as ordered, to
  the right, while I took my seat on one of the back benches of the
  left, against the wall. It was a barn-like structure, large, neat and
  exquisitely chill. Two large stoves on either side possibly had fire
  in them&#8212;an old man who looked like an ancient porter went to
  them from time to time and put on coal&#8212;but the very walls
  reflected a chill, blue glare. The roof was lofty and vaulted, and
  added to the hollow coldness of the hall. The whole apartment was
  clean to sanctity, and in its straitness and blank dreariness no
  unfit emblem of the faith it embodied.</p>

  <p>Around three sides of the hall, and facing the benches for
  visitors, the Shaker fraternity were ranged. The hats and straight
  straw bonnets hung decorously upon the wall over their heads: here
  and there a sky-blue shawl or one of faded lilac hung beneath the
  headgear. Across the wide apartment it was difficult to distinguish
  faces. I scanned <span class="pagenum">[pg 423]</span> closely the
  sisterhood&#8212;old, withered faces most of them, with here and
  there one young and blooming&#8212;but no Bessie as yet. Still, they
  were coming in continually through the side door: she might yet
  appear. I recognized my lady-abbess, who sat directly facing me, in a
  seat of state apparently, and close to her, on the brethren&#39;s
  side of the house, was Elder Nebson.</p>

  <p>The services began. All rose, and sisters and brethren faced each
  other and sang a hymn, with no accompaniment and no melody&#8212;a
  harsh chant in wild, barbaric measure. Then, after a prayer, they
  entered upon the peculiar method of their service. Round and round
  the room they trooped in two large circles, sister following sister,
  brother brother, keeping time with their hanging hands to the rhythm
  of the hymn. Clustered in the centre was a little knot of men and
  women, the high dignitaries, who seemed to lead the singing with
  their clapping hands.</p>

  <p>The circles passed each other and wove in and out, each preserving
  its unbroken continuity. I looked for Elder Nebson: could it be that
  he was joining in these gyrations? Yes, he was leading one of the
  lines. But I noticed that his hands moved mechanically, not with the
  spasmodic fervor of the rest, and that his eyes, instead of the dull,
  heavy stare of his fellows, sought with faithful yet shy constancy
  the women&#39;s ranks. And as the women filed past me, wringing their
  hands, I scrutinized each face and figure&#8212;the sweet-faced
  portress, the shrunken little creole (&quot;A mulatto, she is,&quot;
  Hiram whispered&#8212;he had taken his seat beside me&#8212;&quot;and
  very powerful, they say, among &#39;em&quot;), and some fair young
  girls; two or three of these with blooming cheeks bursting frankly
  through the stiff bordering of their caps. But I saw not the face I
  sought.</p>

  <p>&quot;Them children! Ain&#39;t it awful?&quot; muttered Hiram as a
  file of blue-coat boys shambled past, with hair cut square across
  their foreheads and bleached white with the sun. &quot;Ain&#39;t got
  a grain of sense! Look at &#39;em!&#8212;all crowded clean out by the
  Shaker schools.&quot;</p>

  <p>And surely they were a most unpromising little crowd. Waifs,
  snatched probably from some New York whirlpool of iniquity, and
  wearing the brute mark on their faces, which nothing in this school
  of their transplanting tended to erase&#8212;a sodden little party,
  like stupid young beasts of burden, uncouth and awkward.</p>

  <p>As the girls came round again, and I had settled it in my mind
  that there was certainly no Bessie in the room, I could watch them
  more calmly. Eagerly as I sought her face, it was a relief, surely,
  that it was not there. Pale to ghastliness, most of them, with high,
  sharpened shoulders, and features set like those of a corpse, it was
  indeed difficult to realize that these ascetic forms, these swaying
  devotees, were women&#8212;women who might else have been wives and
  mothers. Some of them wore in their hollow eyes an expression of
  ecstasy akin to madness, and there was not a face there that was not
  saintly pure.</p>

  <p>It was a strange union that assembled under one roof these
  nun-like creatures, wasted and worn with their rigid lives, and the
  heavy, brutish men, who shambled round the room like plough-horses.
  <i>Wicked</i> eyes some of them had, mere slits through which a
  cunning and selfish spirit looked out. Some faces there were of
  power, but in them the disagreeable traits were even more strongly
  marked: the ignorant, narrow foreheads were better, less responsible,
  it seemed.</p>

  <p>The singing ended, there was a sermon from a high priest who stood
  out imperious among his fellows. But this was not a sermon to the
  flock. It was aimed at the scanty audience of strangers with words of
  unblushing directness. How men and women may continue pure in the
  constant hearing and repetition of such revolting arguments and
  articles of faith is matter of serious question. The divine instincts
  of maternity, the sweet attractions of human love, were thrown down
  and stamped under foot in the mud of this man&#39;s mind; and at each
  peroration, exhorting his hearers to shake off Satan, a strong
  convulsive shiver ran through the assembly. &quot;Bessie is certainly
  not here: possibly <span class="pagenum">[pg 424]</span> she&#39;s
  still at Watervliet,&quot; I whispered to; Hiram as the concluding
  hymn began. &quot;But I&#39;ll have a chance at Elder Nebson and that
  woman before they leave; the house.&quot;</p>

  <p>The rain had ceased for some time, and as again the wild chant
  went up from those harsh strained voices, a stray sunbeam, like a
  gleam of good promise, shot across the floor. But what was this
  little figure stealing in through a side-door and joining the
  circling throng?&#8212;a figure in lilac gown, with the stiff muslin
  cap and folded neckerchief. She entered at the farthest corner of the
  room, and I watched her approach with beating heart. Something in the
  easy step was familiar, and yet it could not be. She passed around
  with the rest in the inner circle, and, leaning forward, I held my
  breath lest indeed it might be she.</p>

  <p>The circle opened, and again the long line of march around the
  room. The lilac figure came nearer and nearer, and now I see her
  face. It is Bessie!</p>

  <p>With a cry I sprang up, but with a blow, a crash, a horrible
  darkness swept over me like a wave, and I knew nothing.</p>

  <p>When I came to myself I was lying on a bed in a room that was new
  to me. A strong light, as of the setting sun, shone upon the
  whitewashed wall. There was a little table, over which hung a
  looking-glass, surmounted by two fans of turkey feathers. I stared
  feebly at the fans for a while, and then closed my eyes again.</p>

  <p>Where was I? I had a faint remembrance of jolting in a wagon, and
  of pitying faces bent over me, but where was I now? Again I opened my
  eyes, and noted the gay patchwork covering of the bed, and the green
  paper curtain of the window in the golden wall&#8212;green, with a
  tall yellow flower-pot on it, with sprawling roses of blue and red.
  Turning with an effort toward the side whence all the brightness
  came, in a moment two warm arms were round my neck, and a face that I
  could not see was pressed close to mine.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, Charlie, Charlie! forgive, forgive me for being so
  bad!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Bessie,&quot; I answered dreamingly, and seemed to be
  drifting away again. But a strong odor of pungent salts made my head
  tingle again, and when I could open my eyes for the tears they rested
  on my darling&#39;s face&#8212;my own darling in a soft white dress,
  kneeling by my bedside, with both her arms round me. A vigorous
  patting of the pillow behind me revealed Mrs. Splinter, tearful too:
  &quot;He&#39;s come to now. Don&#39;t bother him with talk, Miss
  Bessie. I&#39;ll fetch the tea.&quot;</p>

  <p>And with motherly insistance she brought me a steaming bowl of
  beef-tea, while I still lay, holding Bessie&#39;s hand, with a feeble
  dawning that the vision was real.</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said as Bessie put out her arm for the bowl,
  &quot;you prop up his head. I&#39;ve got a steddyer hand: you&#39;d
  just spill it all over his go to-meetin&#39; suit.&quot;</p>

  <p>I looked down at myself. I was still dressed in the clothes that I
  had worn&#8212;when was it? last week?&#8212;when I had started for
  the Shaker meeting.</p>

  <p>&quot;How long?&quot; I said feebly.</p>

  <p>&quot;Only this morning, you darling boy, it all happened; and
  here we are, snug at Mrs. Splinter&#39;s, and Mary Jane is getting
  the cottage ready for us as fast as ever she can.&quot;</p>

  <p>How good that beef-tea was! Bessie knew well what would give it
  the <i>sauce piquante</i>. &quot;Ready for us!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Here&#39;s the doctor at last,&quot; said Hiram, putting his
  head in at the door. &quot;Why, hillo! are we awake?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The doctor! Dr. Wilder?&quot; I said beamingly. How good of
  Bessie! how thoughtful!</p>

  <p>&quot;Not Dr. Wilder, you dear old boy!&quot; said Bessie,
  laughing and blushing, &quot;though I sha&#39;n&#39;t scold you,
  Charlie, for that!&quot; in a whisper in my ear. &quot;It&#39;s Dr.
  Bolster of Lee. Hiram has been riding all over the country for him
  this afternoon.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ll go down to him,&quot; I said, preparing to
  rise.</p>

  <p>&quot;No you won&#39;t;&quot; and Mrs. Splinter&#39;s strong arm,
  as well as Bessie&#39;s soft hand, patted me down again.</p>

  <p>Dr. Bolster pronounced, as well he might, that all danger was
  over. The <span class="pagenum">[pg 425]</span> blow on my
  head&#8212;I must have struck it with force against the projecting
  window-shelf as I sprang up&#8212;was enough to have stunned me; but
  the doctor, I found, was inclined to theorize: &quot;A sudden
  vertigo, a dizziness: the Shaker hymns and dances have that effect
  sometimes upon persons viewing them for the first time. Or perhaps
  the heat of the room.&quot; He calmly fingered my pulse for a few
  seconds, with his fat ticking watch in his other hand, and then
  retired to the bureau to write a prescription, which I was
  indignantly prepared to repudiate. But Bessie, in a delightful little
  pantomime, made signs to me to be patient: we could throw it all out
  of the window afterward if need be.</p>

  <p>&quot;A soothing draught, and let him keep quiet for a day or so,
  will be all that is required. I will call to-morrow if you would
  prefer it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;We will send you a note, doctor, to-morrow morning: he seems
  so much stronger already that perhaps it will not be necessary to
  make you take such a long drive.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, yes, I&#39;m very busy. You send me word whether to
  come or not.&quot;</p>

  <p>And bustlingly the good doctor departed, with Mrs. Splinter
  majestically descending to hold whispered conference with him at the
  gate.</p>

  <p>&quot;Charlie, I <i>will</i> send for Dr. Wilder if you are ready,
  for I&#39;m never going to leave you another minute as long as we
  live.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I think,&quot; said I, laughing, &quot;that I should like to
  stand up first on my feet; that is, if I have any feet.&quot;</p>

  <p>What a wonderful prop and support was Bessie! How skillfully she
  helped me to step once, twice, across the floor! and when I sank
  down, very tired, in the comfortable easy-chair by the window, she
  knelt on the floor beside me and bathed my forehead with fragrant
  cologne, that certainly did not come from Mrs. Splinter&#39;s tall
  bottle of lavender compound on the bureau.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, my dear boy, I have <i>so</i> much to say! Where shall I
  begin?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;At the end,&quot; I said quietly. &quot;Send for Dr.
  Wilder.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But don&#39;t you want to hear what a naughty
  girl&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, I want to hear nothing but &#39;I, Elizabeth, take
  thee&#8212;&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But I&#39;ve been so very jealous, so suspicious and angry.
  <i>Don&#39;t</i> you want to hear how bad I am?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; I said, closing the discussion after an old
  fashion of the Sloman cottage, &quot;not until we two walk together
  to the Ledge to-morrow, my little wife and I.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Where&#39;s a card&#8212;your card, Charlie? It would be
  more proper-like, as Mrs. Splinter would say, for you to write
  it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I will try,&quot; I said, taking out a card-case from my
  breast-pocket. As I drew it forth my hand touched a package, Fanny
  Meyrick&#39;s packet. Shall I give it to her now? I hesitated. No,
  we&#39;ll be married first in the calm faith that each has in the
  other to-day, needing no outward assurance or written word.</p>

  <p>I penciled feebly, with a very shaky hand, my request that the
  doctor would call at Hiram Splinter&#39;s, at his earliest
  convenience that evening, to perform the ceremony of marriage between
  his young friend, Bessie Stewart, and the subscriber. Hiram&#39;s
  eldest son, a youth of eight, was swinging on the gate under our
  window. To him Bessie entrusted the card, with many injunctions to
  give it into no other hands than the doctor&#39;s own.</p>

  <p>In less time than we had anticipated, as we looked out of the
  window at the last pink glow of the sunset, the urchin reappeared,
  walking with great strides beside a spare little-figure, whom we
  recognized as the worthy doctor himself.</p>

  <p>&quot;Good gracious! he <i>is</i> in a hurry!&quot; said Bessie,
  retiring hastily from the window; &quot;and we have not said a word
  to Mrs. Splinter yet!&quot;</p>

  <p>We had expected the little doctor would wait below until the
  bridal-party should descend; but no, he came directly up stairs, and
  walked into the room without prelude. He took Bessie in his arms with
  fatherly tenderness: &quot;Ah, you runaway! so you&#39;ve come back
  at last?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, doctor, and don&#39;t you let go of her until you have
  married her fast to me.&quot;</p><span class="pagenum">[pg
  426]</span>

  <p>&quot;Ahem!&quot; said the doctor, clearing his throat, &quot;that
  is just what I came to advise you about. Hiram told me this afternoon
  of the chase you two had had, and of your illness this morning. Now,
  as it is half over the village by this time that Bessie Stewart has
  been rescued from the Shaker village by a chivalrous young gentleman,
  and as everybody is wild with impatience to know the
  <i>dénoûment</i>, I want you to come down quietly to the church this
  evening and be married after evening service.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;To please everybody?&quot; I said, in no very pleasant
  humor.</p>

  <p>&quot;I think it will be wisest, best; and I am sure this
  discreetest of women,&quot; still holding Bessie&#39;s hand,
  &quot;will agree with me. You need not sit through the service. Hiram
  can bring you down after it has begun; and you may sit in the vestry
  till the clerk calls you. I&#39;ll preach a short sermon
  to-night,&quot; with a benignant chuckle.</p>

  <p>He had his will. Some feeling that it would please Mrs. Sloman
  best, the only person besides ourselves whom it concerned us to
  please, settled it in Bessie&#39;s mind, although she anxiously
  inquired several times before the doctor left if I felt equal to
  going to church. Suppose I should faint on the way?</p>

  <p>I was equal to it, for I took a long nap on the sofa in Mrs.
  Splinter&#39;s parlor through the soft spring twilight, while Bessie
  held what seemed to me interminable conferences with Mary Jane.</p>

  <p>It was not a brilliant ceremony so far as the groom was concerned.
  As we stood at the chancel-rail I am afraid that the congregation,
  largely augmented, by this time, by late-comers&#8212;for the doctor
  had spread the news through the village far and wide&#8212;thought me
  but a very pale and quiet bridegroom.</p>

  <p>But the bride&#39;s beauty made amends for all. Just the same soft
  white dress of the afternoon&#8212;or was it one like it?&#8212;with
  no ornaments, no bridal veil. I have always pitied men who have to
  plight their troth to a moving mass of lace and tulle, weighed down
  with orange-blossoms massive as lead. This was my own little wife as
  she would walk by my side through life, dressed as she might be the
  next day and always.</p>

  <p>But the next day it was the tartan cloak that she wore, by special
  request, as we climbed the hill to the Ledge. It was spring
  indeed&#8212;bluebirds in the air, and all the sky shone clear and
  warm.</p>

  <p>&quot;Let <i>me</i> begin,&quot; said my wife as she took her old
  seat under the sheltering pine. &quot;You can&#39;t have anything to
  say, Charlie, in comparison with me.&quot;</p>

  <p>There was a short preliminary pause, and then she
  began.</p><a name="churchstepschxii" id="churchstepschxii">

  <h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

  <p>&quot;Well, after you wouldn&#39;t take me to Europe, you
  know&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You naughty girl!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No interruptions, sir. After you <i>couldn&#39;t</i> take me
  to Europe I felt very much hurt and wounded, and ready to catch at
  any straw of suspicion. I ran away from you that night and left you
  in the parlor, hoping that you would call me back, and yet longing to
  hide myself from you too. You understand?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, let us not dwell on that.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, I believe I never thought once of Fanny Meyrick&#39;s
  going to Europe too until she joined us on the road that
  day&#8212;you remember?&#8212;at the washerwoman&#39;s
  gate.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes; and do <i>you</i> remember how Fidget and I barked at
  her with all our hearts?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I was piqued then at the air of ownership Fanny seemed to
  assume in you. She had just come to Lenox, I knew; she could know
  nothing of our intimacy, our relations; and this seemed like the
  renewal of something old&#8212;something that had been going on
  before. Had she any claim on you? I wondered. And then, too, you were
  so provokingly reticent about her whenever her name had been
  mentioned before.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Was I? What a fool I was! But, Bessie dear, I could not say
  to even you, then, that I believed Fanny Meyrick was in&#8212;cared a
  great deal for me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I understand,&quot; said Bessie nodding. &quot;We&#39;ll
  skip that, and take it for granted. <span class="pagenum">[pg
  427]</span> But you see <i>I</i> couldn&#39;t take anything for
  granted but just what I saw that day; and the little memorandum-book
  and Fanny&#39;s reminiscences nearly killed me. I don&#39;t know how
  I sat through it all. I tried to avoid you all the rest of the day. I
  wanted to think, and to find out the truth from Fanny.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I should think you <i>did</i> avoid me pretty successfully,
  leaving me to dine coldly at the hotel, and then driving all the
  afternoon till train-time.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It was in talking to Fanny that afternoon that I discovered
  how she felt toward you. She has no concealment about her, not any,
  and I could read her heart plainly enough. But then she hinted at her
  father&#39;s treatment of you; thought he had discouraged you,
  rebuffed you, and reasoned so that I fairly thought there might be
  truth in it, <i>remembering it was before you knew me.&quot;</i></p>

  <p>&quot;Listen one minute, Bessie, till I explain that. It&#39;s my
  belief, and always was, that that shrewd old fellow, Henry Meyrick,
  saw very clearly how matters were all along&#8212;saw how the
  impetuous Miss Fanny was&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Falling in love</i>: don&#39;t pause for a &#39;more
  tenderer word,&#39; Charlie. Sam Weller couldn&#39;t find
  any.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, falling in love, if you <i>will</i> say it&#8212;and
  that it was decidedly a difficult situation for me. I remember so
  well that night on the piazza, when Fanny clung about me like a
  mermaid, he bade her sharply go and change her dripping garments, and
  what Fanny calls &#39;a decidedly queer&#39; expression came into his
  face. He could not say anything, poor old chap! and he always behaved
  with great courtesy to me. I am sure he divined that I was a most
  unimpassioned actor in that high-comedy plunge into the
  Hudson.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very well: I believe it, I&#39;m sure, but, you see, how
  could I know then what was or was not true? Then it was that I
  resolved to give you leave&#8212;or rather give her leave to try. I
  had written my note in the morning, saying <i>no</i> finally to the
  Europe plan, and I scrawled across it, in lead-pencil, while Fanny
  stood at her horse&#39;s head, those ugly words, you
  remember?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said: &quot;&#39;Go to Europe with Fanny
  Meyrick, and come up to Lenox, both of you, when you
  return.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Then, after that, my one idea was to get away from Lenox.
  The place was hateful to me, and you were writing those pathetic
  letters about being married, and state-rooms, and all. It only made
  me more wretched, for I thought you were the more urgent now that you
  had been lacking before. I hurried aunt off to Philadelphia, and in
  New York she hurried me. She would not wait, though I did want to,
  and I was so disappointed at the hotel! But I thought there was a
  fate in it to give Fanny Meyrick her chance, poor thing! and so I
  wrote that good-bye note without an address.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But I found you, for all, thanks to Dr.
  R&#8212;&#8212;!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, and when you came that night I was so happy. I put away
  all fear: I had to remind myself, actually, all the time, of what I
  owed to Fanny, until you told me you had changed your passage to the
  Algeria, and that gave me strength to be angry. Oh, my dear, I&#39;m
  afraid you&#39;ll have a very bad wife. Of course the minute you had
  sailed I began to be horribly jealous, and then I got a letter by the
  pilot that made me worse.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But,&quot; said I, &quot;you got my letters from the other
  side. Didn&#39;t that assure you that you might have faith in
  me?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But I would not receive them. Aunt Sloman has them all, done
  up and labeled for you, doubtless. She, it seems&#8212;had you talked
  her over?&#8212;thought I ought to have gone with you, and fretted
  because she was keeping me. Then I couldn&#39;t bear it another day.
  It was just after you had sailed, and I had cut out the ship-list to
  send you; and I had worked myself up to believe you would go back to
  Fanny Meyrick if you had the chance. I told Aunt Sloman that it was
  all over between us&#8212;that you might continue to write to me, but
  I begged that she would keep all your letters in a box until I should
  ask her for them.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But I wrote letters to her, too, asking what had become of
  you.&quot;</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 428]</span>

  <p>&quot;She went to Minnesota, you know, early in
  February.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And why didn&#39;t you go with her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;She scolded me dreadfully because I would not. But she was
  so well, and she had her maid and a pleasant party of Philadelphia
  friends; and I&#8212;well, I didn&#39;t want to put all those
  hundreds of miles between me and the sea.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And was Shaker Village so near, then, to the sea?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, Charlie,&quot; hiding her face on my shoulder,
  &quot;that was cowardice in me. You know I meant to keep the cottage
  open and live there. It was the saddest place in all the world, but
  still I wanted to be there&#8212;alone. But I found I could not be
  alone; and the last people who came drove me nearly wild&#8212;those
  R&#8212;&#8212;s, Fanny Meyrick&#39;s friends&#8212;and they talked
  about her and about you, so that I could bear it no longer. I wanted
  to hide myself from all the world. I knew I could be quiet at the
  Shaker village. I had often driven over there with Aunt Sloman:
  indeed, Sophia&#8212;that&#39;s the one you saw&#8212;is a great
  friend of Aunt Maria&#39;s.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;So the lady-abbess confessed, did she?&quot; I asked with
  some curiosity.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes: she said you were rudely inquisitive; but she excused
  you as unfamiliar with Shaker ways.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And were you really at Watervliet?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, but don&#39;t be in a hurry: we&#39;ll come to that
  presently. Sophia gave me a pretty little room opening out of hers,
  and they all treated me with great kindness, if they <i>did</i> call
  me Eliza.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And did you,&quot; I asked with some impatience, remembering
  Hiram&#39;s description&#8212;&quot;did you sew beads on velvet and
  plait straw for mats?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nonsense! I did whatever I pleased. I was parlor-boarder, as
  they say in the schools. But I did learn something, sir, from that
  dear old sister Martha. You saw <i>her</i>?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The motherly body who invited me in?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes: isn&#39;t she a dear? I took lessons from her in all
  sorts of cookery: you shall see, Charlie, I&#39;ve profited by being
  a Shakeress.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, my darling, but did you&#8212;you didn&#39;t go to
  church?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Only once,&quot; she said, with a shiver that made her all
  the dearer, &quot;and they preached such dreary stuff that I told
  Sophia I would never go again.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But did you really wear that dress I saw you in?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;For that once only. You see, I was at Watervliet when you
  came. If you had only gone straight there, dear goose! instead of
  dodging in the road, you would have found me. I had grown a little
  tired of the monotony of the village, and was glad to join the party
  starting for Niskayuna, it was such a glorious drive across the
  mountain. I longed for you all the time.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Pretty little Shakeress! But why did they put us on such a
  false track?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, we had expected to reach home that night, but one of the
  horses was lame, and we did not start as soon as we had planned. We
  came back on Saturday afternoon&#8212;Saturday afternoon, and this is
  Monday morning!&quot;, leaning back dreamily, and looking across the
  blue distance to the far-off hills. &quot;Then I got your card, and
  they told me about you, and I knew, for all the message, that
  you&#39;d be back on Sunday morning. But how could I tell then that
  Fanny Meyrick would not be with you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Bessie!&quot; and my hand tightened on hers.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, Charlie, you don&#39;t know what it is to be jealous. Of
  course I did know that&#8212;no, I didn&#39;t, either, though I must
  have been <i>sure</i> underneath that day. For it was more in fun
  than anything else, after I knew you were in the
  meeting-house&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;How did you know?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I saw you drive up&#8212;you and Hiram and Mrs.
  Hiram.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You didn&#39;t think, then, that it was Mrs.
  Charles?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;So I stole into Sophia&#39;s room, and put on one of her
  dresses. She is tall too, but it did not fit very well.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I should think not,&quot; I answered, looking down
  admiringly at her.</p>

  <p>&quot;In fact,&quot; laughing, &quot;I took quite a time
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 429]</span> pinning myself into it and
  getting the neckerchief folded prim. I waited till after the sermon,
  and then I knew by the singing that it was the last hymn, so I darted
  in. I don&#39;t know what they thought&#8212;that I was suddenly
  converted, I suppose, and they would probably have given thanks over
  me as a brand snatched from the burning. Did I do the dance well? I
  didn&#39;t want to put them out.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;My darling, it was a dreadful masquerade. Did you want to
  punish me to the end?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I was punished myself, Charlie, when you fell. Oh dear!
  don&#39;t let&#39;s talk about the dreadful thing any more. But I
  think you would have forgiven Elder Nebson if you had seen how
  tenderly he lifted you into the wagon. There, now: where are we going
  to live in New York, and what have we got to live on besides my
  little income?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Income! I had forgotten you had any.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ask Judge Hubbard if I haven&#39;t. You&#39;ll
  see.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But, my dear,&quot; said I gravely, drawing forth the packet
  from my breast, &quot;I, too, have my story to tell. I cannot call it
  a confession, either; rather it is the story of somebody
  else&#8212;Hallo! who&#39;s broken the seal?&quot; For on shipboard I
  had beguiled the time by writing a sort of journal to accompany
  Fanny&#39;s letter, and had placed all together in a thick white
  envelope, addressing it, in legal parlance, &quot;To whom it may
  concern.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>I</i> did,&quot; said Bessie faintly, burying her face on
  my arm. &quot;It fell out of your pocket when they carried you up
  stairs; and I read it, every word, twice over, before you came to
  yourself.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You little witch! And I thought you were marrying me out of
  pure faith in me, and not of sight or knowledge.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It was faith, the highest faith,&quot; said Bessie proudly,
  and looking into my eyes with her old saucy dash, &quot;to know, to
  feel sure, that that sealed paper concerned nobody but me.&quot;</p>

  <p>And so she has ever since maintained.</p>

  <h2>A STRANGE LAND AND A PECULIAR PEOPLE.</h2>

  <p>A nodule of amygdaloid, a coarse pebble enveloped in a whitish
  semi-crystalline paste, lies on the table before me. I know that a
  blow of the hammer will reveal the beauties of its crystal interior,
  but I do not crush it. It is more to me as it is&#8212;more than a
  letter plucked from the stone pages of time. Coarse and plain, it is
  an index to a chapter of life. In the occupations of a busy existence
  we forget how much we owe to the sweet emotional nature which, by
  mere chance association, retains the dearer part of the past fixed in
  memory, just as the graceful volutes of a fossil shell are preserved
  in the coarse matrix of a stony paste. In this way the nodule
  connects itself with my emotional life, and recalls the incidents of
  this sketch.</p>

  <p>We were journeying over the mountains in the autumn of 1869. Our
  camp was pitched in a valley of the ascending ridges of the
  Cumberland range, on the south-east border of Kentucky. At this point
  the interior valley forms the letter J, the road following the bend,
  and ascending at the foot of the perpendicular.</p>

  <p>It is nearly an hour since sunset, but the twilight still lingers
  in softened radiance, mellowing the mountain-scenery. The camp-wagons
  are drawn up on a low pebbly shelf at the foot of the hills, and the
  kindled fire has set a great carbuncle in the standing pool. A spring
  branch oozes out of the rocky turf, and flows down to meet a shallow
  river fretting over shoals. The road we have followed hangs like a
  rope-ladder from the <span class="pagenum">[pg 430]</span> top of the
  hills, sagging down in the irregularities till it reaches the
  river-bed, where it flies apart in strands of sand. The twilight
  leans upon the opposite ridge, painting its undulations in
  inconceivably delicate shades of subdued color. Although the night is
  coming on, the clear-obscure of that dusk, like a limpid pool,
  reveals all beneath. A road ascending the southern hill cuts through
  a loamy crust a yellow line, which creeps upward, winding in and out,
  till nothing is seen of it but a break in the trees set clear against
  the sky. No art of engineer wrought these graceful bends: it is a
  wild mountain-pass, followed by the unwieldy buffalo in search of
  pasturage. Beyond, the mountain rises again precipitously, a ragged
  tree clinging here and there to the craggy shelves. Around and
  through the foliage, like a ribbon, the road winds to the top. A blue
  vapor covers it and the hills melting softly in the distance. At the
  base of the hills a little river winds and bends to the west through
  a low fertile bottom, the stem of the J, which is perhaps a mile in
  width. It turns again, its course marked by a growth of low
  water-oaks and beeches, following the irregular fold in the hills
  which has been described.</p>

  <p>Leaning against the bluffs hard by the camp is a low white
  cottage, with its paddock and pinfold, and the cattle are coming up,
  with bells toning irregularly as they feed and loiter on the way. The
  supper-horn sends forth a hoarse but mellow fugue in swells and
  cadences from the farm-house. Over all this sweet rural scene of
  mountain, valley, river and farm, and over the picturesque camp, with
  stock, tent and wagons, now brightened by the grace of a young girl,
  the twilight lingers like love over a home. As I listen and look a
  soft voice from the carriage at my side says, &quot;Is the ground
  damp? May I get out?&quot;</p>

  <p>I turn to my little prisoner, and as the mingled lights cross her
  features I see that her wide, dark-gray eyes are swimming in tears.
  &quot;Why, what is it?&quot; I ask.</p>

  <p>&quot;Nothing: everything is so sweet and tranquil. I was
  wondering if our new home would be like this&#8212;not the hills and
  valleys, you know, but so quiet and homelike.&quot;</p>

  <p>So homelike! With that vague yearning, we, like so many
  Southerners of the period, were wagoning from old homesteads, a
  thousand miles of travel, to a resting-place.</p>

  <p>&quot;It will be like home if you are there,&quot; I think as I
  assist her to alight&#8212;the burden daily growing lighter in my
  arms and heavier on my heart&#8212;but I say nothing.</p>

  <p>Pretty soon she is at her usual relaxation, looking for shells,
  ivy berries and roots of wild vines to adorn that never-attainable
  home. The kindly, generous twilight, so unlike the swift shrift of
  the Florida levels, still lingers; and presently, amid bits of
  syenite, volcanic tuff and scoria, she has found this nodule of
  amygdaloid. It differs from the fossil shells and alluvial pebbles
  she is used to find, and she is curious about it.</p>

  <p>I tell the story of the watershed of the Ohio as well as I
  can&#8212;how it was the delta of a great river, fed by the surfage
  of a continent lying south&#8212;eastwardly in the Atlantic; of the
  luxuriant vegetation that sprang up as in the cypress-swamps of her
  old home in Louisiana, passing, layer by layer, into peat, to be
  baked and pressed into bituminous coal, that slops over the flared
  edges of the basin in Pennsylvania, like sugar in the kettles, and is
  then burnt to anthracite. I promise her that in some dawn on the
  culminating peak, when the hills below loom up, their tops just
  visible like islands in a sea of dusk, I will show her a natural
  photograph of that old-world delta, with the fog breaking on the
  lower cliffs like the surf of a ghostly sea. She listens as to a
  fairy tale, and then I tell her of the stellar crystals concealed in
  the rough crust of the amygdaloid. She puts it away, and says I shall
  break it for her when we get home. We have traveled a long way, by
  different paths, since then, but it has never been broken&#8212;never
  will be broken now.</p>

  <p>In addition to the geological and botanical curiosities the
  mountains afford, my companion had been moved alternately to tears
  and smiles by the scenes <span class="pagenum">[pg 431]</span> and
  people we met&#8212;their quaint speech and patient poverty. We
  passed eleven deserted homesteads in one day. Sometimes a lean cur
  yelped forlorn welcome: at one a poor cow lowed at the broken paddock
  and dairy. We passed a poor man with five little children&#8212;the
  eldest ten or twelve, the youngest four or five&#8212;their little
  stock on a small donkey, footing their way over the hills across
  Tennessee into Georgia. It was so pitiful to see the poor little
  babes-in-the-wood on that forlorn journey; and yet they were so
  brave, and the poor fellow cheered them and praised them, as well he
  might. Another miserable picture was at the white cottage near our
  camp. The lawn showed evidences of an old taste in rare flowers and
  vines, now choked with weeds. I knocked, and a slovenly negress
  opened the door and revealed the sordid interior&#8212;an unspread
  bed; a foul table, sickly with the smell of half-eaten food and
  unwashed dishes; the central figure a poor, helpless old man sitting
  on a stool, I asked the negress for her master: she answered rudely
  that she had no master, and would have slammed the door in my face.
  Why tell the story of a life surrounded by taste and womanly
  adornments, followed by a childless, wifeless old age? The poor,
  wizened old creature was rotting in life on that low stool among his
  former dependants, their support and scorn. The Emancipation
  Proclamation did not reach him. But one power could break his bonds
  and restore the fallen son and the buried wife&#8212;the great
  liberator, Death.</p>

  <p>The natives of this region are characterized by marked
  peculiarities of the anatomical frame. The elongation of the bones,
  the contour of the facial angle, the relative proportion or
  disproportion of the extremities, the loose muscular attachment of
  the ligatures, and the harsh features were exemplified in the notable
  instance of the late President Lincoln. A like individuality appears
  in their idiom. It lacks the Doric breadth of the Virginian of the
  other slope, and is equally removed from the soft vowels and liquid
  intonation of the southern plain. It has verbal and phraseological
  peculiarities of its own. Bantering a Tennessee wife on her choice,
  she replied with a toss and a sparkle, &quot;I-uns couldn&#39;t get
  shet of un less&#39;n I-uns married un.&quot; &quot;Have you&#39;uns
  seed any stray shoats?&quot; asked a passer: &quot;I-uns&#39;s uses
  about here.&quot; &quot;Critter&quot; means an
  animal&#8212;&quot;cretur,&quot; a fellow-creature.
  &quot;Longsweet-&#39;nin&#39;&quot; and &quot;short
  sweet&#39;nin&#39;&quot; are respectively syrup and sugar. The use of
  the indefinite substantive pronoun <i>un</i> (the French <i>on</i>),
  modified by the personals, used demonstratively, and of
  &quot;done&quot; and &quot;gwine&quot; as auxiliaries, is peculiar to
  the mountains, as well on the Wabash and Alleghany, I am told, as in
  Tennessee. The practice of dipping&#8212;by which is meant not
  baptism, but chewing snuff&#8212;prevails to a like extent.</p>

  <p>In farming they believe in the influence of the moon on all
  vegetation, and in pork-butchering and curing the same luminary is
  consulted. Leguminous plants must be set out in the light of the
  moon&#8212;tuberous, including potatoes, in the dark of that
  satellite. It is supposed to <i>govern</i> the weather by its dip,
  not <i>indicate</i> it by its appearance. The cup or crescent atilt
  is a wet moon&#8212;i.e., the month will be rainy. A change of the
  moon forebodes a change of the weather, and no meteorological
  statistics can shake their confidence in the superstition. They, of
  course, believe in the water-wizard and his forked wand; and their
  faith is extended to the discovery of mineral veins. While writing
  this I see the statement in a public journal that Richard Flannery of
  Cumberland county (Kentucky) uses an oval ball, of some material
  known only to himself, which he suspends between the forks of a short
  switch. As he walks, holding this extended, the indicator announces
  the metal by arbitrary vibrations. As his investigations are said to
  be attended with success, possibly the oval ball is highly
  magnetized, or contains a lode-stone whose delicate suspension is
  affected by the current magnetism, metallic veins being usually a
  magnetic centre. Any mass of soft iron in the position of the
  dipping-needle is sensibly magnetic, <span class="pagenum">[pg
  432]</span> and a solution of continuity is thus indicated by the
  vibrations of the delicately poised instrument. Flaws in iron are
  detected with absolute certainty by this method. More probably,
  however, the whole procedure is pure, unadulterated humbug. In all
  such cases the failures are unrecorded, while the successes are
  noted, wondered at and published. By shooting arrows all day, even a
  blind man may hit the mark sometimes.</p>

  <p>During this journey it was a habit with me to relate to my invalid
  companion any fact or incident of the day&#39;s travel. She came to
  expect this, and would add incidents and observations of her own. In
  this way I was led to compile the following little narrative of
  feminine constancy and courage during the late war.</p>

  <p>It begins with two boys and a girl, generically divided into
  brother and sister and their companion, living on the divide-range of
  mountains between Kentucky and Tennessee. The people raised hogs,
  which were fattened on the mast of the range, while a few weeks&#39;
  feeding on corn and slops in the fall gave the meat the desired
  firmness and flavor. They cultivated a few acres of corn, tobacco and
  potatoes, and had a kitchen-garden for &quot;short sass&quot; and
  &quot;long sass&quot;&#8212;leguminous and tuberous plants. Apples
  are called &quot;sour sass.&quot; The chief local currency was
  red-fox scalps, for which the State of Kentucky paid a reward: the
  people did not think of raising such vermin for the peltry, as the
  shrewder speculator of a New England State did. They sold venison and
  bear-meat at five cents a pound to the lame trader at Jimtown, who
  wagoned it as far as Columbia, Kentucky, and sold it for seventy-five
  cents. They went to the log church in the woods on Sundays, and
  believed that Christ was God in the flesh, with other old doctrines
  now rapidly becoming heretical in the enlightened churches of the
  East. Living contentedly in this simple way, neither rich nor poor,
  the lads grew up, nutting, fishing, hunting together, and the
  companion naturally looked forward to the day when he would sell
  enough peltry and meat to buy a huge watch like a silver biscuit,
  such as the schoolmaster wore, make a clearing and cabin in the wild
  hills, and buy his one suit of store clothes, in which to wed the
  pretty sister of his friend.</p>

  <p>Then came the war. Although it divided the two friends, the old
  kindness kept their difference from flaming forth in the vendetta
  fashion peculiar to the region. It was a great deal that these two
  young fellows did not believe that military morality required them to
  shoot each other on sight. Yet, on reconsideration, I will not be so
  sure of their opinion on this point. Perhaps they thought that,
  morally and patriotically, they ought to do this, and were conscious
  of weakness and failure of duty in omitting to do it. Perhaps the old
  good-will survived for the girl&#39;s sake; and if so, I do not think
  the Union was the worse preserved on that account.</p>

  <p>The young lover went into the ranks of Wolford&#39;s regiment of
  loyal mountaineers, and rose&#8212;slowly at first, more rapidly as
  his square sense and upright character became known.</p>

  <p>The girl, in her retirement, heard of her lover&#39;s advancement
  with pride and fear. She distrusted her worth, and found the hard
  menial duties of life more irksome than before. Not that she shrank
  from labor, but she feared its unfitting her for the refinement
  required by her lover&#39;s new social position. She had few examples
  to teach her the small proprieties of small minds, but a native
  delicacy helped her more than she was conscious of. She read her
  Bible a great deal, and used to wonder if Mary and &quot;the other
  Mary&quot; were ladies. She thought Peter was probably an East
  Tennesseean, or like one, for when he denied his Lord they said he
  did not talk like the others. It seemed hard that to say
  &quot;we-uns&quot; and &quot;you-uns,&quot; as she habitually did,
  though she tried not, and to use the simple phrases of her childhood,
  should be thought coarse or wrong. Such matters were puzzles to her
  which she could not solve. She got an old thumbed Butler&#39;s
  <i>Grammar</i> and tried hard to correct the vocables of her truant
  tongue. I <span class="pagenum">[pg 433]</span> am afraid she made
  poor progress. She had a way of defying that intolerable tyrant, the
  nominative singular, and put all her verbs in the plural, under an
  impression, not without example, that it was elegant language. She
  had enough hard work to do, poor girl! to have been quit of these
  mental troubles. Her brother was away, her parents were old, and all
  the irksome duties of farm-house and garden fell upon her. She had to
  hunt the wild shoats on the range, and to herd them; to drive up the
  cows, and milk them; to churn and make the butter and cheese. She
  tapped the sugar trees and watched the kettles, and made the maple
  syrup and sugar; she tended the poultry, ploughed and hoed the corn
  field and garden, besides doing the house-work. Her old parents could
  help but little, for the &quot;rheumatiz,&quot; which attacks age in
  the mountains, had cramped and knotted their limbs, and they were fit
  for nothing except in fine dry weather. Surely, life was hard with
  her, without her anxieties about her lover&#39;s constancy and her
  own defects. Letter-writing was a labor not to be thought of. She
  tried it, and got as far as &quot;I am quite well, and I hope these
  few lines will find you the same,&quot; and there stopped. She
  ascribed the difficulty to her own mental and clerical defects, but I
  think it lay quite as much in the nature of the relation. How was she
  to express confidence when she distrusted? how express distrust when
  her maidenly promptings told her it was an indelicate solicitation?
  She could say Brindle had gone dry and the blind mare had foaled, or
  that crops were good; but what was that to say when her heart was
  thirsting and drying up? She blotted the paper and her eyes and her
  hands, but she could not write a line. She was a sensible girl, and
  gave it up, leaving her love to grow its own growth. The tree had
  been planted in good ground, and watered: it must grow of itself.</p>

  <p>By and by military operations brought her lover into the old
  neighborhood. I cannot say he put on no affectations with his new
  rank, that he did not air his shoulder-straps a taste too much; but
  the manly nature was too loyal to sin from mere vanity. He seemed
  natural, easy, pleased with her, and urged a speedy wedding.</p>

  <p>We may guess how the Lassie&#8212;we must give her a name, and
  that will do&#8212;worshiped her King Cophetua in shoulder-straps.
  Had he not stooped from his well-won, honorable height, the serene
  azure of his blue uniform, to sue for her? In all the humility of her
  pure loving heart she poured out her thankfulness to the Giver of all
  good for this supreme blessing of his love.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this peace and content her brother appeared with a
  flag of truce. He was hailed as a prosperous prodigal, for he too was
  a lad of metal, but he brought one with him that made poor Lassie
  start and tremble. It was a lady, young and beautiful, clad in deep
  mourning. Although sad and retiring, there was that dangerous charm
  about her which men are lured by, and which women dread&#8212;a
  subtle influence of look and gesture and tone that sets the pulses
  mad. She was going for the remains of her husband, and told a
  pathetic story, but only too well. She used always the same language,
  cried at the same places, and seemed altogether too perfect in her
  part for it to be entirely natural. So, at least, Lassie thought,
  even while reproaching herself for being hard on a sister in
  affliction. Yet she could not escape the bitterness of the thought
  that the widow, Mrs. G&#8212;&#8212;, was &quot;a real
  lady&quot;&#8212;that ideal rival she had been so long dreading in
  her lover&#39;s absence; and now that he had come, the rival had also
  come.</p>

  <p>Her brother dropped a hint or two about the lady: Mrs.
  G&#8212;&#8212; had the &quot;shads,&quot; &quot;vodles&quot; of
  bank-stock and niggers, and she paid well for small service. If King
  Cophetua could get leave to escort her to head-quarters, Mrs.
  G&#8212;&#8212; would foot the bills and do the handsome thing. It
  was hard such a woman should have to go on such a sad business
  alone.</p>

  <p>What could his sister say? She had herself put off the wedding a
  month: she wanted to get her ample store of <span class="pagenum">[pg
  434]</span> butter, eggs and poultry to the trader at Jimtown, or,
  better still, to the brigade head-quarters at Bean&#39;s Station.
  With her own earnings she could then buy such simple muslins for her
  wedding-dress as became her and would not shame her lover. She wished
  she had married him, as he had urged, in her old calico gown. If he
  had asked her now, if he had pressed a little, she would have
  yielded; but he did not. He seemed to accept the proprieties and
  woman&#39;s will as unalterable. In fact, he did follow Mrs.
  G&#8212;&#8212;&#39;s motions with only too lively an admiration.
  Perhaps he did not know himself what his feelings were&#8212;what
  this new fever in his pulses meant. Besides the calm, holy connubial
  love there is a wild animal passion that tears through moral creeds
  and laws. Once, Lassie saw her brother give him a half-angry stare,
  that passed into a laugh of cool scorn. &quot;Take care of Mrs.
  G&#8212;&#8212;,&quot; he said to King Cophetua. &quot;You will get
  bit there if you don&#39;t look out.&quot;</p>

  <p>How the sister would have pressed that warning had she dared!
  Innocent as her lover might be, she believed that Mrs.
  G&#8212;&#8212; saw the growing passion and encouraged it. But there
  was nothing to take hold of. There was nothing bold, forward or
  inviting in her manner. If a lady has long lashes, must she never
  droop them lest she be charged with coquetry? May not a flush spring
  as naturally from shy reserve as from immodesty?</p>

  <p>Lassie&#39;s lover did take charge of this dangerous siren to
  escort her to the head-quarters at Louisville. But just before
  starting he came to Lassie with a certain eagerness, as one who is
  going into battle might, and assured her, again and again, of his
  faith. Did he do this to assure her or himself? I think the last.</p>

  <p>How weary the month was! She occupied herself as well as she could
  with her sales and purchases, making a very good trade. The brigade
  had been at Bean&#39;s Station long enough to eat up all the
  delicacies to be found there, so that the little maid, who was a
  sharp marketer, got fabulous prices. She made up her simple wedding
  furniture, gave her mother a new gown and underwear, and pleased her
  old father with a handsome jean suit, the labor of her own nimble
  fingers. All that belonged to her would appear well on that day, as
  became them and her.</p>

  <p>At any other time she would have followed up that thrifty market
  at Bean&#39;s Station. She would have huckstered around the
  neighborhood, and made a little income while it lasted; but now she
  had no heart for it. Her lover&#39;s leave was out, yet his
  regimental associates knew nothing about him.</p>

  <p>A week after the day set for her marriage her brother came again
  with the flag of truce. He too was vexed&#8212;not so much at
  Cophetua&#39;s absence as at not meeting the widow, whom he had been
  sent to escort to the Confederate lines. But he treated his
  sister&#39;s jealous suspicions with a dash of scorn: &quot;There was
  nothing of that kind, but if Cophetua would fool with a loaded gun,
  he must expect to be hurt. If ever there was a hair-trigger, it was
  Mrs. G&#8212;&#8212;.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Who is she?&quot; asked his sister eagerly. &quot;Tell me:
  you say there is something strange, dangerous about her, and I can
  see it. Who is she?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Humph!&quot; said her brother. &quot;She is a lady, and that
  is enough. If she is dangerous, keep out of her way.&quot;</p>

  <p>This only deepened the mystery. But she had no time to think. Her
  brother left in the morning. In the afternoon the colonel of her
  lover&#39;s regiment came to see her with a very grave face. The
  young man had been arrested for dealing with the enemy, harboring
  spies and furnishing information of the disposition and number of the
  Federal forces. &quot;If we could get at the true story of his
  connection with that woman,&quot; said the colonel, &quot;I am
  satisfied he has only been indiscreet, not treacherous. He is one of
  my best, most trusted officers, and his arrest is a blot on the
  regiment. If he will tell anybody, he will tell you. Can you go to
  Louisville at once?&quot;</p>

  <p>Yes, at once. The traveling-dress, made up for so different an
  occasion, was donned, and under escort she went, by a hundred miles
  of horseback ride, <span class="pagenum">[pg 435]</span> to the
  nearest railway station. There was no tarrying by the way: the
  colonel&#39;s influence provided relays. On the evening of the third
  day she was with her lover.</p>

  <p>It was as the colonel had supposed: the woman had got her lover in
  her toils, and he had been imprudent. He had every reason for
  believing that her story of her husband&#39;s remains was false. She
  was a dealer in contraband goods: this much he knew. Other officers,
  of higher rank, knew as much, and corresponded with her. If they
  chose to wink at it, was he, a subordinate, to interfere? She had
  trusted him, depended on him, and he had a feeling that it would be
  disloyal to her confidence to betray her, to pry into what she
  concealed, and expose what his superiors seemed to know. But after
  she was gone the story leaked out: she was not only a smuggler, but a
  very dangerous spy. Some one must be the scapegoat, and who so fit as
  the poor, friendless Tennesseean who had escorted her to
  head-quarters and acted for her in personal matters?</p>

  <p>That was his story, but what a poor story to tell to a
  court-martial! What was she to do? Poor, simple child of the woods!
  what did she know of the wheels within wheels, and the rings of
  political influence by which a superior authority was to be invoked?
  She knew nothing of these things, and there was no one to tell her.
  She thought of but one plan: her brother could find that woman. She
  would seek her out&#8212;she would appeal to her.</p>

  <p>We need not follow her on that return journey and her visit to the
  Confederate camp. Fortunately, the Confederates were nearer than she
  supposed. She came upon their pickets, and was taken into the
  commanding officer&#39;s presence. Her brother was sent for, and when
  he came she told him she was looking for his friend, Mrs.
  G&#8212;&#8212;.</p>

  <p>&quot;Looking for her!&quot; said her brother. &quot;Why, that is
  what we moved out this way for! She is in camp now. We brought her
  and her luggage in last night.&quot;</p>

  <p>She eagerly entreated to be taken to her, and was carried to a
  pavilion, or marquee, a little apart from the officers&#39; quarters.
  Mrs. G&#8212;&#8212; came in richly but simply dressed, attended by a
  portly, handsome, but rather dull-looking officer.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, Lassie!&quot; said Mrs. G&#8212;&#8212; in surprise.
  &quot;So you have come to see me? Here are the remains of my poor
  dear,&quot; she added with a little laugh, presenting the gentleman.
  &quot;Do you think he is worth all the trouble I took to get
  him?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ha! much pleased! Devilish proper girl!&quot; said the man
  with a stupid blush, justifying the stolidity of his good looks.</p>

  <p>&quot;But where is your <i>preux chevalier</i>, Captain Cophetua?
  I declare, I almost fell in love with him myself. Frank here is quite
  jealous.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, Mrs. G&#8212;&#8212;,&quot; broke out the poor girl,
  &quot;you have killed him! They are going to try him and hang him for
  helping you to spy.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; said the lady with a little start. &quot;The
  poor fellow did nothing but what, as a gentleman, he was compelled to
  do. But how can I help you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Save him,&quot; said Lassie. &quot;You have your wealth,
  your wit, your husband: I have but him!&quot; and she sank down in
  tears.</p>

  <p>&quot;Stupid,&quot; said the lady, turning sharply on her husband,
  &quot;tell me what to do? Don&#39;t you see we must not let them hang
  the poor fellow?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Of course not,&quot; said the big man dryly. &quot;Just
  countermand the order of execution. No doubt the Yankees will obey: I
  would.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Of course you would: a precious life you would lead if you
  did not,&quot; said his wife, who evidently commanded that squad.
  &quot;Never mind: there is more sense in what you said than I
  expected of you&#8212;Jane,&quot; to the smart maid who attended on
  her, &quot;pen, ink, paper and my portfolio.&quot;</p>

  <p>Opening the last, she took out a bundle of letters, and, running
  them rapidly over as a gambler does his cards, she selected one.
  &quot;This,&quot; she said to Lassie, &quot;is a note from General
  &#8212;&#8212;. It is written without the slightest suspicion
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 436]</span> of my character as a spy; but
  you will see it involves him far more dangerously than your friend.
  He cannot well explain it away. Keep the letter. I will write to him
  that you have it to deliver over in return for his kind assistance in
  effecting the release of your friend. Don&#39;t fear: I ask him to do
  nothing he ought not to do without asking, and you give him a letter
  that would be misconstrued if it fell into other hands.&quot;</p>

  <p>Armed with these instructions and the letters, Lassie returned
  home, passed on to Louisville, and delivered her message. The general
  promptly interfered, thanking her for calling his attention to the
  matter. His influence, and a more exact understanding of the means
  and appliances of the artful widow in obtaining information, effected
  her lover&#39;s acquittal and restoration to his former position.</p>

  <p>&quot;I owe her my life and good name,&quot; said the tall
  Tennesseean, taking Baby No. 2 from her arms. &quot;I-uns ain&#39;t
  wuth such a gal.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; say I drily. &quot;What did you take him
  for?&quot; to her. Then I get the answer before quoted. But my
  companion, with a truer perception, went quietly up and kissed her
  Tennessee sister, a little to the surprise of both, I think, but they
  seemed touched by the silent little tribute more than by any
  words.</p>

  <p>I have spoken of the character of the hostilities in that
  &quot;debatable land.&quot; War is a bad thing always, but when it
  gets into a simple neighborhood, and teaches the right and duty of
  killing one&#39;s friends and relatives, it becomes demoniac. Down
  about Knoxville they practiced a better method. There it was the old
  game of &quot;Beggar your Neighbor,&quot; and they denounced and
  &quot;confiscated&quot; each other industriously. Up in the poor
  hills they could only kill and burn, and rob the stable and
  smoke-house. We were shown the scene of one of these neighborhood
  vengeances. It is a low house at the side of a ravine, down whose
  steep slope the beech forest steps persistently erect, as if
  distrusting gravitation. Thirty Confederates had gathered in that
  house at a country-side frolic, and the fiddle sang deep in the
  night. The mountain girls are very pretty, having dark, opalescent
  eyes, with a touch of gold in them at a side glance, slight, rather
  too fragile figures, and the singular purity of complexion peculiar
  to high lands.</p>

  <p>The moon went down, and the music of the dance, the shuffle of
  feet on the puncheon floor, died away into that deep murmurous chant,
  the hymn of Nature in the forest. The falling water, sleeping in the
  dam or toiling all day at the mill, gurgles like the tinkling of
  castanets. Every vine and little leaf is a harp-string; every tiny
  blade of grass flutes its singly inaudible treble; the rustling
  leaves, chirping cricket, piping batrachian, the tuneful hum of
  insects that sleep by day and wake by night, mingle and flow in the
  general harmony of sound. The reeds and weeds and trunks of trees,
  like the great and lesser pipes of an organ, thunder a low bass. The
  melancholy hoot of the owl and the mellow complaint of the
  whippoorwill join in the solemn diapason of the forest, filling the
  solitudes with grand, stately marches. There are no sounds of Nature
  or art so true in harmony as this ceaseless murmur of the American
  woods. So accordant is it with the solemn majesty of form and color
  that the observer fails to separate and distinguish it as an isolated
  part in the grand order of Nature. He has felt an indescribable awe
  in the presence of serene night and unbounded shadow, but to divide
  and distinguish its constituent causes were as vain as in the contour
  and color of a single tree to note the varied influence of rock, soil
  and river.</p>

  <p>Over the little farm-house in the ravine in the fall of 1863 there
  fell with the sinking moon these solemn dirges of the great dark
  woods. The stars brightened their crowns till <i>Via Lactea</i> shone
  a highway of silver dust or as the shadow of that primeval river
  rolling across the blue champaign of heaven. The depths of repose
  that follow the enjoyment of the young irrigated their limbs, filling
  the sensuous nerves and arteries with a delicious narcotism&#8212;a
  deep, quiet, healthful sleep, lulled by the chant of the serene
  mother-forest.</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 437]</span>

  <p>Hush! A light step, like a blown leaf: the loose wooden latch
  rises at the touch of a familiar hand; familiar feet, that have
  trodden every inch of that poor log floor, lead the way; and then all
  at once, like a bundle of Chinese crackers, intermingled with shrieks
  and groans and deep, vehement curses, the rapid reports of pistols
  fill the chambers. The beds, the floors, the walls, the doors are
  splashed with blood, and the chambers are cumbered with dead and
  dying men in dreadful agony. Happy those who passed quietly from the
  sweet sleep of Nature to the deeper sleep of death! Of thirty young
  men in the flush of youth, not one escaped. Six Federal scouts had
  threaded their way since sunset from the Federal lines to do this
  horrible work. Oh, Captain Jack, swart warrior of the Modocs! must we
  hang you for defending your lava-bed home in your own treacherous
  native way, when we, to preserve an arbitrary political relation,
  murder sleeping men in their beds?</p>

  <p>Let me close with an incident of that great game of war in which
  the watershed of the Ohio was the gambler&#39;s last stake.</p>

  <p>The Confederacy was a failure in &#39;62, held together by
  external pressure of hostile armies. It converted civil office into
  bomb-proofs for the unworthy by exempting State and Federal
  officials; it discouraged agriculture by levying on the corn and
  bacon of the small farmers, while the cotton and sugar of the rich
  planter were jealously protected; it discouraged enlistment by
  exempting from military service every man who owned twenty negroes,
  one hundred head of cattle, five hundred sheep&#8212;in brief, all
  who could afford to serve; it discouraged trade by monopolies and
  tariffs. But for the ubiquitous Jew it would have died in
  1862-&#39;63, as a man dies from stagnation of the blood. It was the
  rich man&#39;s war and the poor man&#39;s fight.</p>

  <p>This suicidal policy had its effect. Cut off from all markets, the
  farmer planted only for family use. At the close of the war the
  people of Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas had to be fed by the
  government. The farmers in 1864 refused to feed the Southern army.
  Seventy thousand men deserted east of the Mississippi between October
  1, 1864, and February 3, 1865. They were not recalled: the government
  could not feed them. The Confederacy was starved out by its own
  people&#8212;rather by its own hideous misgovernment, for the people
  were loyal to the cause.</p>

  <p>One fact was apparent as early as 1863: the South would not feed
  the armies&#8212;the North must. That plan, so far as the Atlantic
  coast States were involved, was foiled at Gettysburg. The only
  resource left was in the West, the watershed of the Ohio, which
  Sherman was wrenching out of General Johnston&#39;s fingers. In a
  military point of view, the great Confederate strategist was right:
  he was conducting the campaign on the principle Lee so admirably
  adopted in Virginia. But President Davis had more than a military
  question to solve. If he could not seize the granaries of the
  watershed, the Confederacy would die of inanition.</p>

  <p>That was what caused the change of commanders in Georgia, and the
  desperate invasion that blew to pieces at Nashville; and it
  introduces a little scouting incident upon which the event of that
  campaign may have partially turned. General Hood was in camp at
  Jonesborough: Forrest and Wheeler were detached to destroy
  Sherman&#39;s single thread of supplies. Prisoners pretended to have
  been on half rations, and the sanguine opinion at head-quarters was
  that Sherman was on the grand retreat. That able strategist had
  disappeared, enveloping himself in impenetrable vidette swarms of
  cavalry. He had pocketed one hundred thousand men in the Georgia
  hills, and no one could find them; at least, General Hood could
  not.</p>

  <p>But others were not sanguine about Sherman&#39;s falling back.
  General Jackson selected a major, a trusted scout, with twenty-five
  men, with instructions to find Sherman. Again and again the scout and
  his little band tried to pierce that impenetrable cloud, and could
  not. Then he tried another plan. He snapped <span class="pagenum">[pg
  438]</span> up a Federal squad, clothed a select part of his little
  band in their uniform, and sent the others back with the prisoners.
  Then he plunged boldly into the cloud, a squad of Federals, bummers,
  pioneers. Does the reader reflect upon the fine fibre of the material
  requisite for such an exploit? It is not strength, courage or
  tactical cunning that is most wanted, but that most difficult art, to
  be able to put off your own nature and put on another&#39;s&#8212;to
  play a part, not as the actor, who struts his hour in tinsel and
  mouths his speeches as no mortal man ever walked or talked in real
  life, but as one who stakes his life upon a word, an accent;
  requiring subtlety of analytic sense and quickness of thought.
  Polyglot as was the speech of the Federal forces, suspicion, started
  by that test, would run rapidly to results. Then there was the danger
  of collision with the regiment whose uniform they had assumed. Swift,
  constant motion was required. They swept to the head of the column,
  and, to be brief, the first Federal pontoon thrown across the
  Chattahoochee was laid with the assistance of these spies. The leader
  threw himself on the bank and counted the regiments by their insignia
  as they passed, until he saw the linen duster and the glittering
  staff of the great commander himself as they clattered over the
  bridge. Then to Campbellton, hard by, where their horses were
  rendezvoused, and whip and spur to Jonesborough.</p>

  <p>A council of war was sitting when the scout arrived. He was
  hurried into its presence, and told his story with laconic, military
  precision. Sherman&#39;s whole force was across the Chattahoochee and
  marching on Jonesborough, twenty miles away.</p>

  <p>&quot;I have sure information to the contrary,&quot; said the
  commanding general, singularly deceived by a strong conviction,
  enforced by scouts who depended on rumor for authority. &quot;It is
  some feint to cover the general movement.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I counted the flags, guidons, regimental insignia&#8212;such
  force of cavalry, artillery, infantry,&quot; giving the numbers.
  &quot;I saw and recognized General Sherman,&quot; said the scout
  briefly.</p>

  <p>His report was not, even then, credited, but, as a precaution, a
  brigade of cavalry, with his battalion in the van, was sent out to
  beat up the enemy. A short distance beyond Flint River they struck
  the Federal line, which attacked at once, without feeling&#8212;a
  sure indication of strength. The battalion was hurled back on the
  brigade, the brigade rushed across Flint River, and back into the
  infantry line, now throwing up tardy entrenchments at Jonesborough.
  The rest is historical. It was but one of the rash throws of the dice
  for that great stake, the watershed of the Ohio, and helps to show
  the principles of military action by which it was lost.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

  <p>One great feature of the Hof has hitherto been passed over in
  silence&#8212;the other lodgers; for, truth to say, there happened to
  be a large family of tourists, who, following in the wake of their
  parents and grandparents before them, strenuously adhered year after
  year to the peaceful old Hof as their summer residence.
  <i>Schwalben</i> by name, they had English and American cousins, the
  swallows and martins: they pursued a yearly routine of spending the
  winter months with other connexions in Algeria or the Levant, then,
  dividing into groups, returned to their various mountain or pastoral
  homes in cooler, more verdant lands. Thus, on the second Wednesday in
  the month of May one family always arrived at the old castle of
  Neuhaus, giving a sentiment to the forsaken ruin which it could not
  otherwise possess, and about the same week a number of their cousins
  and distant connexions took up their quarters at the Hof.</p><a name=

  <p>The swallows in the Tyrol pass for holy birds. There is a
  tradition that their forefathers helped the Lord Almighty to build
  the firmament, but how and in what manner popular tradition does not
  tell us. Being blessed by God and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, the
  simple peasant often leaves his doors and windows open to attract
  such valued inmates, seeing that peace and happiness enter with them,
  and lightning never strikes the roof where swallows build. Should
  they forsake a house in the course of the summer, it is a sign of
  coining misfortune. He who kills a swallow will lose father or
  mother.</p>

  <p>A firm belief in the goodness of the swallows made Kathi honor and
  welcome the familiar visitants. &quot;They were no greedy
  guests,&quot; she said, &quot;for they always arrived when the bins
  of meal and winter provisions were empty, and in the autumn, as soon
  as they were filled again, they were off without bite or
  bit.&quot;</p>

  <p>Many an old deserted room in the high-pitched roof was given over
  to these inoffensive, man-loving birds. Hundreds of nests, some in
  good condition, <span class="pagenum">[pg 440]</span> others deserted
  and out of repair, clung to old beams, rafters and wainscots. A
  steady sound of fluttering and juvenile chirping issued through the
  closed doors, contrasting with the silence of the long stone
  corridor, whilst parent birds whirled gracefully in and out through
  the dusty open windows, or poised themselves on the warm shingles of
  the roof. The grandest, most comfortable quarters were afforded in a
  large unused chamber occupying the front gable; and, curiously
  enough, either in reality or fancy, we could not help observing that
  whilst the various members of the community lived fraternally
  together, there still seemed to be a distinction between the swallows
  who dwelt in these spacious quarters and those who lived in humbler
  lodgings behind. You might imagine that the dwellers in front had
  become rich through trade, for they suffered no more from the
  perpetual booming of the great house-clock above their heads, or from
  the ever-moving pendulum which pulsated like a living thing in their
  midst, than a manufacturer from the constant sound of his busy
  steam-engines and rattling machinery. This swallow domain soon became
  known as Castle Clock-Tower, and the chief inmates as the Herr and
  Frau von Schwalbe and family, whilst, oddly enough, if it was our
  daily pleasure to watch them, they showed an equal curiosity and
  interest in us.</p>

  <p>I do not know whether they considered that the fly-papers in our
  sitting-room might be thwarting the designs of Providence on their
  behalf, but we had hardly begun using them for the destruction of the
  flies, when Herr von Schwalbe flew down from his castle through the
  open window, apparently sent as a deputy to remonstrate with us on
  this reckless waste of their legitimate game. He fluttered about,
  glancing at the dead bodies strewn on the floor; then, taking his
  post on the top of a picture hanging on the wall, remained several
  hours, drawing his own deductions, but always too timid to raise a
  complaint. In vain we tried to encourage him, to induce him to leave
  his lofty position: the lonely visitant remained timidly stationary,
  so that night came on before he ventured his flight.</p>

  <p>Although Herr von Schwalbe might not approve of our unscrupulous
  destruction of flies, he must have reported us a well-meaning family,
  seeing that his wife ever afterward treated us with the greatest
  confidence. She was an elegant lady, with the most approved Grecian
  bend. She gave a kettle-drum once to her friends and relations at the
  unseasonable hour of four o&#39;clock in the morning, but in all
  other cases observed her character of a wise, prudent little matron.
  Day by day she conducted her happy family to a horizontal pole
  suitably fastened to the upper gallery, where she cultivated their
  intellects, and, assisted by her devoted husband, gave them flying
  and singing lessons, each vocal attempt being rewarded by a liberal
  supply of flies.</p>

  <p>We likewise became interested in a couple of redstarts, who,
  waxing bold, would tap at the casement, bidding us come and admire
  their young in the nest under the portico. This was during our first
  visit: on our second we found some dire misfortune had befallen the
  mother, the children and the nest. The Hofbauer feared some servant
  must have destroyed them. The poor little father remained attached to
  the melancholy spot, and, refusing to be comforted because his dear
  ones were not, flew round perpetually with a worm in his bill. In his
  despair he would drop it untouched with piteous laments, until, as if
  his small instinct had become crazed, he would go in search of a
  fresh dainty morsel, and the sad scene was enacted over again. Poor
  forlorn bird! Like the swallows, the redstarts are dedicated to the
  Virgin: such high patronage, however, in this case availed
  nothing.</p>

  <p>Neither did Anton&#39;s crossbill, which dwelt in the stube, have
  a much happier fate. Although its master was very fond of it and
  tended it well, it had, like others of its race, to live in a very
  small prison suspended but a short way from the centre of the dark
  paneled ceiling. Thus, in the winter between our two visits it died,
  suffocated by the hot air <span class="pagenum">[pg 441]</span> of
  the overheated, ill-ventilated stube. Many poor pet birds of this
  species are thus killed, the victims of ignorance; for when a
  crossbill becomes sickly from its dark, hot, confined quarters, the
  peasant does not wish to cure it, believing that this holy bird,
  which tried to free the Lord from the cross, so sympathizes with
  redeemed humanity that whenever illness or epidemic threatens the
  household the devoted creature itself immediately takes the disease
  and dies, the family escaping unharmed.</p>

  <p>It would be wearisome to enumerate all the different features and
  dispositions of the farm-yard inhabitants. Let us rather pass on to
  Moro. Perhaps it was no pleasant surprise to some of us when the Hof
  bauer having made the purchase of a house-dog, it proved to be none
  other than a large, handsome rusty-black hound which had once sprung
  out of a house near a crossing of the new railway, trying to attack
  my father, who had to defend himself with his stick against the
  disagreeable customer, until a voice from the house made the dog
  instantly and quietly shrink away. The Hofbauer expressed his regret.
  He, knowing nothing of the circumstances, had bought the animal out
  of good-nature, as his master, an Italian and the overseer of the
  railway, removing to a great distance, was forced to part with it. He
  was anything but a savage dog, proving, on the contrary, easily
  cowed; so that the fact of his ever having made such a sally soon
  surprised us. Whether he missed the occupation of looking after the
  work-people and guarding the line, or whether he only understood
  dialectical Italian, certain it is that he proved a most inert,
  taciturn dog. He would wander about for weeks in listless
  despondency, doing nothing for his living, and showing no
  intelligence except in the way of hiding bones. Although really
  young, his extreme slowness and apathy conveyed the idea of an old
  dog. He crept sluggishly along in search of some sunny nook where he
  might snooze in his melancholy. Now, it fell to Moidel&#39;s duty to
  feed this silent, heavy dog, whereupon he, rising gradually out of
  his secret woes, became her constant docile companion, following her
  seriously and silently like a shadow, and looking gravely mortified
  when she refused his attendance at church. He disliked the least
  approach to a liberty, and, showing no interest in what passed around
  him, was regarded by the family rather as a pensioner than an active,
  useful member of the community.</p>

  <p>With E&#8212;&#8212;&#39;s arrival, however, a strange though
  gradual change came over Moro. He seemed from the first to perceive
  the strong sympathy which she possessed for all dumb creatures; and
  had he been the spellbound mortal of the fairy tale the
  transformation could hardly have been more remarkable. As he felt he
  was no longer unappreciated or misunderstood, he began to divide his
  attentions between Moidel and his new friend. He became lively and
  active, condescending to take walks in any direction but
  Bruneck&#8212;a place which, for some inscrutable reason, he
  persistently avoided. He took to opening his huge mouth and uttering
  a sonorous bark; unfurled his tail, which, losing its stiffness,
  wagged incessantly; whilst, developing his liveliness still more, he
  actually took to committing flying leaps over a five-barred gate, and
  running wildly backward and forward in the most ludicrous manner in
  front of the house whenever he perceived his favorite E&#8212;&#8212;
  or some of her friends watching him.</p>

  <p>Autumn had stepped in with the month of September. The harvest was
  carried, and, according to an old custom, the village held a
  thanksgiving service before the sowing of the seed-corn began; and,
  whilst all were generous to their relations, none showed greater
  hospitality than the worthy Hofbauer, who expected not only all his
  own connexions, but also those of his dead wife, to share in the
  annual jubilee.</p>

  <p>Arduous were now the labors of the womankind preparatory to the
  feast. Nanni No. I and Nanni No. 2 of the establishment might be met
  carrying pounds and pounds of fresh meat into the cellar. In the
  stube sat Kathi, seated <span class="pagenum">[pg 442]</span> on one
  of the wooden settees which surrounded the room, her good old face
  bent silently over a paste board placed on one of the square tables
  at which the large family took their meals. This was more convenient
  than in the <i>gewölbe</i>, or huge pantry, which was half buried in
  provender: besides, Kathi thought, it struck damp. But Moidel might
  be found there, with a quiet smile on her dear ruddy face, whilst her
  healthy bare brown arm moved backward and forward with marvelous
  agility in the beating of eggs. Let us step into the gewölbe,
  Kathi&#39;s domain proper. It is a marvelous place. Look at the
  gayly-painted chests of the lowest decorative style of art, choking
  with flour and buckwheat-meal; look at the racks full of heavy,
  flinty household bread; at the pyramid of oblong bladder-like pastry,
  called <i>krapfen</i>, which covers the table; at the smoked tongues,
  pig-cheeks, feet and bologna sausage hanging from the ceiling. Light
  and air are admitted by a large open window, but the atmosphere is so
  impregnated with the odor of cummin (the favorite spice of the Tyrol,
  found in bread, in dishes of vegetables, in puddings and pastry) that
  any sense of great freshness is excluded. Rudely-made presses contain
  lint and linen for accidents or sprains, whilst endless lotions and
  remedies are carefully preserved in a long range of little
  drawers&#8212;cloves, ginger, dried hyssop, fennel, anis and sage,
  all excellent remedies for keeping the cold out of the stomach, to
  say nothing of a discreet bottle of schnapps for the same purpose.
  There is many another herb, dried by the careful Kathi between the
  two Lady Days, Mary&#39;s ascension and Mary&#39;s birthday, which
  may usefully be employed for man or beast&#8212;mullein, a very
  amulet against every kind of cough and sore-throat; plantain,
  wormwood, red and white mugwort; nor are the scrapings of hartshorn
  bought from a mountain huntsman forgotten. At this moment, however,
  no one is dreaming for an instant of being ill: that might happen
  after, but must not precede the feast.</p>

  <p>Kathi and Moidel, experienced cooks and housewives, work steadily
  on, without feeling the least anxiety for the success of their
  stupendous efforts. They are only amazed that we should be surprised
  at the quantity of their work&#8212;that they can remain, in fact, so
  cool in the midst of their hundred and one boilings, singeings,
  choppings and fryings. Kathi certainly wipes the perspiration off her
  brow, but Moidel cannot even allow herself leisure for the act. The
  dinner would not be in time if they stopped to enter the chapel, even
  for Rosenkranz. So all the womankind repeat their Hail Marys hurrying
  backward and forward. Then Moidel retires to snatch a few hours of
  rest, wakes with a start, and is again alert at midnight, when,
  attended, rather than aided, by two maids in waking stupefaction, the
  baking, boiling and steaming receive a continuous impetus, Kathi
  reappearing at four for the last triumphant efforts.</p>

  <p>In good time the Hofbauer and Anton are equipped in their gala
  attire for church, Moidel and the maids, in spite of their nocturnal
  labors, following them briskly; so that they have not only said their
  prayers and endeavored to understand the sermon, but actually joined
  in a procession before the guests arrive. The sweet notes of a
  processional hymn still float on the silent, balmy air as the sound
  of advancing wheels is heard. Then several one-horse gigs are seen
  approaching, and the geese hiss drowsily at the happy-faced
  <i>bauers</i> and <i>bauerins</i>, and their flocks of healthy,
  chubby children stuffed in before and behind; and so they drive
  carefully into the large yard, where Onkel Johann, acting as hostler,
  proudly though bashfully receives them.</p>

  <p>There is a sober gayety and rejoicing about the elders, a
  suppressed merriment about the youngsters. They do not expect much
  waiting upon before the feast. They know that a strong but silent
  friendship exists between them all and their host&#8212;that they are
  ready to help each other in any possible emergency without making a
  fuss about it. So the Hofbauer can walk back leisurely from church,
  and Kathi can attend to <span class="pagenum">[pg 443]</span> her
  onerous duties in the kitchen, without a single visitor feeling
  slighted.</p>

  <p>Soon the crowd of simple guests is seated at table in the large
  sitting-room, which we have vacated for the occasion. The Hofbauer
  stands at a side-table and carves, and Anton in his long white apron
  and bib waits as serving-man. Onkel Johann, however, sits at table.
  The aunt and Moidel are busy dishing below: they will have their
  share of good things when they go to the return feasts. Of pickings
  and leavings there are none: it would be an insult to send away a
  half-emptied plate; and for the same reason no dish is left
  untouched, though it is a banquet that might even satiate a
  work-house. Soup, sausage, roast veal, baked apples and stewed
  prunes; stewed liver, fried liver, millet pudding; boiled beef with
  horseradish and beet-root; hung beef; cabbage dished with tongue and
  pork; noodles; and then a second soup to wash down what has gone
  before, but followed by more substantial in the form of liver-cake,
  in which that ingredient has been baked with bread-crumbs, eggs,
  onions and raisins. Then come batter dumplings, one sort of
  <i>knödel</i> sprinkled with poppy-seeds, roast beef with salad, and
  finally coffee.</p>

  <p>There is little talking; only a clatter of plates, dishes, knives
  and forks as the honest guests deliberately but persistently vanquish
  each stage of the feast.</p>

  <p>After coffee, &quot;the mother&#39;s own sister&quot; is called
  aside by Kathi, in order that she, for her own and the dear dead
  Hofbauerin&#39;s sake (of whom, bless her! in Kathi&#39;s eyes she is
  the very image), may be privately presented to us, the foreign
  Herrschaft. A comely, compact little figure, with delicate features,
  small hands and feet, and a pair of dove-like eyes.</p>

  <p>Wishing to be polite, she says it is <i>gar curios</i> that any of
  the Herrschaft should understand German. Immediately she fears this
  implies ignorance on our part, and adds an apology: &quot;But
  certainly such Herrschaft who are so up in things of heaven and earth
  would know German.&quot;</p>

  <p>Then she waits with a sense of relief for one of us to speak. At
  this moment, however, a bevy of bright, cheerful little
  peasant-girls, who have been hovering in the distance, taking
  courage, approach and cluster in a ring around her. She shows by her
  face that she fears this is a liberty, but is nevertheless relieved
  by their supporting her. We ask their names, and she goes off into a
  string of Madels, Lisies, Nannies, who all smile spontaneously, and
  have not only to set her right as to their ages, but, to their
  infinite astonishment, as to their relationship to herself.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, mother, I am your daughter!&quot; says one little girl
  reproachfully. &quot;Why, aunt, my mother is dead, you know!&quot;
  adds another, pulling at her sleeve and whispering this correction.
  Then the whole group burst into a shy titter.</p>

  <p>The good soul stands calmly this battery of juvenile reproaches:
  &quot;Ho, are not you all my children? Have I not brought you all
  through the measles, knitted the stockings for all your feet, until I
  taught you to knit for yourselves? Souls and bodies, you are all dear
  to me: I treat you all alike.&quot;</p>

  <p>She looks so lovingly on them that they are not quite sure whether
  they have done right or wrong in correcting her. So they stand a
  dumb, admiring circle, whilst she adds:</p>

  <p>&quot;If the Herrschaft ever could get as far as Pfalzen, where I
  and the children live, they would find no great big house like the
  Hof, but plenty of small, snug farms amidst corn-fields, in any one
  of which the Hof-Herrschaft would be made welcome, but more
  especially in mine. It is not so very far. See from the window!
  There, over Sankt Jörgen and over the woods rises our tall spire with
  two other spires; only these are quite a long way from each other,
  though they are all mixed-like at a distance, just as I mix up the
  young people. The Herrschaft will not forget the
  name&#8212;Pfalzen?&quot;</p>

  <p>Having brought out this invitation with a great effort, she now
  plunges into a sea of fears as to the liberty she has taken. So one
  of the Herrschaft, rashly coming to her assistance, assured her it
  would be impossible for her at least <span class="pagenum">[pg
  444]</span> to forget the name of Pfalzen. Somebody had told her of a
  certain tailor of Pfalzen who, within memory of man, returning from a
  wedding at Percha, and having passed St. George on his homeward way
  at eight o&#39;clock of the evening, suddenly saw the road divide
  before him. This made him stop in astonishment, and before he could
  decide which way to take it had grown dark. Then he became sore
  afraid, especially when he espied a group of ladies dressed in white,
  who came up to him, and, addressing him in playful tones, encompassed
  and stopped him. He, however, could not stand this, and speaking in a
  loud tone he reproached them, for, though they were ladies, he soon
  saw by their rude looks that they meant him mischief. Then they began
  abusing and tormenting him, until he laid himself down on the ground
  with his face to the earth. Now the spell seemed broken, for, though
  the spiteful women remained, they were restrained from hurting him;
  and with the first sound of the morning Angelus these white ladies,
  who were nothing but tormenting spirits, fled, and he, rising up,
  went on his way home.</p>

  <p>&quot;Herr Je!&quot; said the gentle little woman, &quot;could it
  have been the Hof Moidel who told you <i>that</i>? Or could you have
  heard it at Percha? or by the fire some winter evening? But you have
  never been in these parts in winter. The tailor, you see, must have
  found the wedding-wine too strong.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Barbara the sewing-woman&#8212;&quot; began a young voice,
  which immediately collapsed, the speaker retreating with great
  impetuosity behind her mother or aunt, whichever it might be.</p>

  <p>Then each little member of the maidenly circle looked very odd,
  and their good relative uttered hurriedly but mildly, &quot;Oh,
  it&#39;s nothing. How could you, Lisi? Behave yourselves,
  children!&quot;</p>

  <p>However, an explanation of the sewing-woman Barbara being pleaded
  for on our part, the good woman nervously continued: &quot;It is only
  a foolish story. Only that the sewing-woman Barbara was sweet on
  Weaver Thomas, and he could not abide her. &#39;I would rather,&#39;
  he told her, &#39;be a beast in the stall than be your wedded
  husband.&#39; The sewing-woman said he should rue the day he thus
  insulted her. And sure enough, from that time he could neither eat
  nor drink, growing poor and thin in the body. Everybody said,
  &#39;Sewing-woman Barbara has struck him with the evil eye.&#39; I am
  not sure but that his teeth chattered, which they say is a sign. A
  miller urged him to have the letters I.N.R.I. stitched into his
  clothes (it is a wonderful preservative on corn-bins and stable doors
  against the evil eye), but Weaver Thomas replied he was sick of
  stitching. Yet what is to become of the man? Not a drop of wine does
  he touch now but it flies to his head&#8212;not a kreuzer of his
  hard-earned money does he put into his pocket but it oozes away like
  water. Ah, it is an ugly story! I wish there were no such fearsome,
  boggy things. The world would be better without them.&quot;</p>

  <p>By this time a fat lad had ventured up, and stood gaping behind
  the maidens. He was not of Pfalzen, but the girls spoke to him as a
  cousin of the house. In spite of their encouragement, he merely gaped
  and stared, without answering a word. The pleasures of the table had,
  in fact, brought him into a state of speechless discomfort. It was
  not of wine that he had partaken, though it had freely circulated, to
  judge by the great empty gallon bottles, but he had stuck loyally to
  the principles laid down and acted on by his elders, of doing full
  justice to the dishes. Feeling now, therefore, exceedingly the worse
  for his praiseworthy exertions, he remained leaning disconsolately
  with his back against the wall long after the church-bells had struck
  up a merry clang, vigorously calling the Hofbauer, his men-servants
  and maid-servants and the strangers who were within his gates, to
  church. Good Kathi, however, whilst clearing away the empty glasses,
  looked compassionately upon him as on one of her fattening chickens
  in danger of pip, and patiently inveigled him to a cozy nook down
  stairs, where his heavy breathing and steady snorts kept time to her
  monotonous dish-washing. On he slept during prayers, during the hour
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 445]</span> spent at the Blauen Bock, when
  the Hofbauer treated the priest and his guests on this auspicious
  thanksgiving-day. He woke up, however, to do his duty like a man
  &quot;with a mouthful of supper&quot; whilst the horses were being
  put into the gigs. Then, in a state of heavy, speechless resignation,
  he was conveyed to his seat between a bauer and his wife, which,
  though a tight fit in the morning, had strangely become tighter, and
  where, circumstances thus pinning his arms to his side, and with his
  aching head upon his breast in the most uncomfortable of attitudes,
  the poor fat boy was jolted away in the twilight.</p>

  <p>The other relations, all weightier mortals, more or less, than
  when they arrived, were packed and squeezed into their creaking
  vehicles; the very small vacuums remaining on or under the seats, to
  say nothing of broad laps, being filled with krapfen. You would
  indeed have supposed that the Hof were one great patent krapfen
  manufactory, with the sole right of making, baking by steam and
  selling these indigestible, leathery, yet brittle puffs so dear to
  the Tyrolese palate, had not the figures of men, women and children,
  humble guests at more modest dwellings, been seen filing along the
  highway or crossing the moorland slopes, each bearing a light but
  bulging bundle of krapfen tied up in a gay blue, crimson or yellow
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a krapfen dispensation. A piled-up offering stood in
  the little oratory employed as a store-room by us; the cock crowed
  and the hens clucked for their share of the Herrschaft&#39;s krapfen
  under the parlor windows in the early morning; the men- and
  maid-servants hurried buoyantly into town to sell their krapfen
  perquisites to less favored mortals; the pedestrian bricklayer and
  carpenter, respectable men with money stored away in their broad
  belts&#8212;portions of that great army of Tyrolese who, possessing
  neither trade nor manufactures in their native land, are forced in an
  ant-like manner to stray into Bavaria and Austria until they can
  return laden with their winter store, since the mere fattening of
  cattle cannot support a nation,&#8212;these respectable but footsore
  men, wending their way from Steiermark, were received with a hearty
  welcome and krapfen; and the wandering family, who were not at all
  respectable, but were treated with some distrust and more
  commiseration&#8212;the traveling tinker, his dark-eyed, dark-skinned
  wife and saucy, grimy children, who were barred and bolted with their
  barrow, their rags and their kettles in the barn that night as in a
  traveler&#39;s rest&#8212;ate with marvelous relish their
  bountiful-gleanings of this great krapfen harvest.</p><a name=

  <h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

  <p>Cold rain and mist have now set in. The landscape, which has from
  the first possessed a peculiar charm for us, is often blotted from
  view. The varied, undivided yet most individual range of dolomites
  which rises on the edge of the eastern horizon, instead of melting
  under the soft influences of warm sunshine and quivering air into
  glowing crimson, purple, palpitating mountains&#8212;which only with
  advancing night turn into gray, motionless pinnacles and battlements
  of the great dolomitic land that stretches beyond&#8212;now remain,
  whenever visible, cold, hard masses of snow, like rigid nuns of some
  ascetic order.</p>

  <p>It is time to be gone. And Fanni, the sturdy, devoted attendant
  specially engaged to wait upon us during the last season, is wild to
  accompany us to Italy&#8212;comfortable Italy, where the washing
  water does not freeze in winter, and where maize <i>polenta</i> is as
  cheap and plentiful as the brown buckwheat <i>plenten</i> of Tyrol.
  She has a good stock of clothes: she wants no wages, only her journey
  paid. Surely we will take her? We give her no hopes, merely promising
  that if we come another year and she be then out of place, we will
  gladly employ her. This is a drop of comfort, and she rushes down
  stairs to convey at least this bit of good news to Kathi.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later we find the <span class="pagenum">[pg
  446]</span> two women, joined by Moidel, standing; against the cellar
  door, which is kept closely shut, that the smell emitted by a vat of
  sauerkraut may not offend the fastidious nostrils of the gentry.
  Kathi has a sprig of rosemary behind her ear, and her bare arms
  wrapped up in her blue apron, always in her case a sign of ease and
  relaxation. She is saying, &quot;Ja, ja, very worrying. Such side
  ways to get hold of the place!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And Munichers too!&quot; adds Moidel&#8212;&quot;so pushing,
  so clamorous!&quot;</p>

  <p>The sight of some brown veils and gentlemen&#39;s hats above the
  garden wall leads to the following explanation from Fanni: &quot;Herr
  Je, just when the Fräulein was speaking of coming back next year, and
  I was thinking to myself how I would help the Kathi to scrub and
  clean beforehand, there were four strange Herrschaft below, who would
  insist on seeing the Hofbauer. And he all in a <i>Schwitz</i>!
  However, he came out of the stube very slowly, wiping his forehead,
  and waited to hear their errand. But when they said they had come to
  secure part of the house from Martini day, and all the rooms not
  wanted by the Hofbauer from Ascension, he had to wipe his forehead
  again before he answered. And then he spoke just like a Herr Curat:
  &#39;This is no lodging-house, where any one can be quartered, my
  Herrschaft. Nor believe that those who occupy my spare rooms are
  casual visitors. Oh no! They are <i>particular friends</i> of mine.
  This old place stands at their disposal: I wish them to be free to
  come or to stay away, but I desire no other faces here.&#39; And
  then,&quot; continues Fanni, &quot;out they slunk, quite sheepish,
  for the Hofbauer looked so tall.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Freilich</i>&quot; added Kathi, &quot;it is not once nor
  twice, but ever since our Herrschaft have had an awning of their own
  on the balcony, and the miller&#39;s mule has stood with a lady&#39;s
  saddle at the entrance&#8212;ever since the Hofbauer had the
  plasterer, and let the joiner make some wardrobes and bedsteads this
  spring, that barefaced strangers have hankered to get the
  place.&quot;</p>

  <p>We have to calm Kathi, bidding her remember that we once came as
  strangers and asked to be taken in.</p>

  <p>Well, so the Herrschaft might. There must be a beginning to all
  good friendships. But it is not for people to thrust themselves in
  when they see the house inhabited, entering even the bed-rooms, and
  stripping the currant bushes without once saying, &quot;With your
  leave.&quot; Why, the <i>Grossmutterli</i> had told her as a child
  that even the empress Maria Theresa&#8212;who took a vast fancy to
  Edelsheim, and passed some nights there&#8212;when she walked up the
  village by herself, and stopped before the Grossmutterli, who was
  ranging her milk-pans on the bench to dry,&#8212;even the stately
  empress said, &quot;My good woman, you live in an uncommonly handsome
  house&#8212;a schloss, in fact. But I won&#39;t give you the trouble
  to show me the inside. Let me rather go into the orchard, for I see a
  young apple tree there marvelously full of fruit.&quot; Grossmutterli
  never showed herself disturbed. She pressed down the latch, led the
  empress to the tree&#8212;it&#39;s standing yet, but is almost worn
  out&#8212;and Maria Theresa said it was a perfect show: there was not
  a tree at her castle of Schönbrunn that bore so well; and she gave
  the Grossmutterli a shining half thaler, which she never parted
  with.</p>

  <p>The next day, Sunday, Kathi stood before us at noon with tears in
  her eyes. The Jakobi, she said, had not only sent down for the
  cow&#39;s crown and ornaments to go on Tuesday, but word as well that
  beautiful Nageli, the queen cow, knocking her head against a rock,
  had broken one horn off. &quot;There&#39;s a pretty go!&quot; she
  continued. &quot;I wish it would bud again. How she will take on! I
  know her ways: she is greedy of praise. I should not wonder if the
  vexation dries her milk, for she knows she can never wear a crown
  again. And Zottel, she&#39;s to be queen&#8212;a sleek, comely cow,
  but never used to a crown. However, Jakobi sends word we need not
  fear her disgracing herself, for he is training her up and down with
  a milking-stool on her head. Cows are more like mortals than brute
  beasts. See the way the two that have stayed at the Hof behave when
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 447]</span> the rest come back. They make
  the stall purgatory to them through their spite or jealousy. But they
  grow more good-tempered after a time.&quot;</p>

  <p>The glittering crown of which poor Nageli&#39;s unfortunate
  accident had deprived her was now produced from its box for us to
  see&#8212;a barbaric structure, in spite of the Christian symbols
  attached. It was two feet high, a foot and a half wide&#8212;all gold
  wire, tinsel, artificial flowers, tassels, fringes of colored
  worsted, and surrounded by a halo of spun glass gay as a slice of the
  rainbow. There was a medallion of the Virgin and Child, and another
  of Saint Anthony, tutelar saint of the Hofbauer&#39;s father, himself
  and his son&#8212;patron, too, of the chapel, and a great helper in
  the recovery of lost calves and sheep, as well as of household goods.
  A red velvet gold-fringed pendant in the form of a heart, handsomely
  embroidered with the cross and sacred initials I.H.S., was suspended
  to all this grandeur. The great massive cow- and ox-bells, some
  tulip-shaped, while others were of the ordinary form, appeared better
  adapted for a belfry than the neck of cattle, and the gay leather
  collars, embroidered with bright worsteds, had likewise sacred
  symbols; thus displaying, when worn at the annual procession, both
  the pride and piety of the bauer.</p>

  <p>The wreaths made at the Olm for the chief oxen, of clustering
  berries, leaves and ribbons, hung, as visible though withered
  trophies of each triumphant descent, amongst the rakes, flails and
  other farm implements in the lower hall; whilst great closets safely
  hid not only the bells and the rest of the substantial properties now
  to be despatched to the Olm, but other brazen pomps and vanities of
  an age gradually becoming obsolete&#8212;the heavy harness, for
  instance, used for the bridal horse when the Hofbauer was
  married&#8212;antiquities suitable for a national museum. The good
  aunt and Moidel, amused by our interest and astonishment, attired the
  latter the same evening, for our gratification, in her mother&#39;s
  wedding-dress. Strong indeed must be the bride who can bear so heavy
  a burden, nor would any but a Tyrolese girl desire thus to be attired
  for the altar: a cloth petticoat ten yards wide, laid in narrow,
  regular folds like an enormous unopened fan; a heavy square-cut
  boddice of dark-green velvet, handsomely worked, and not meeting in
  front, in order to reveal a smart silk stomacher beneath; full white
  linen sleeves, trimmed at the elbow with broad somewhat coarse
  Bohemian lace; and a square collar, with a ruffle of the same to
  match. The cloth dress is, however, completely concealed, except a
  few inches at the bottom, by the huge apron, which is on all
  occasions considered an indispensable addition, no Tyrolese woman
  feeling modest without it. The dainty white knitted cotton stockings,
  with the large fancy clocks and the low-cut, boat-shaped leather
  slippers, with rosettes, are clearly visible. The hair is drawn
  tightly back <i>à la Chinoise</i>, and made into a knot, which is
  surmounted by a little green-and-red cushion, like a bunch of
  strawberries encircled in their leaves.</p>

  <p>Thus Moidel first appeared, followed by Kathi, bidding her walk
  slow and not laugh, for a bride who did so could never be a seemly
  matron. Her niece, consequently suppressing her merriment, again
  disappeared. She returned, however, having replaced the queer little
  cushion by a large black beaver hat, and with a leather belt adorned
  with tin, copper and glass ornaments fastened round her waist, to
  which was attached a richly-ornamented knife-and-fork case, hanging
  down at her side. Thus she was supposed to have returned from church,
  these being the insignia of the wife. And Kathi, seeing our interest
  increase rather than diminish, at her intimation Anton speedily
  appeared attired in his father&#39;s long wedding-coat, an enormous
  broad-brimmed, flapping felt hat of a green canary shade on his head,
  and displaying prominently a large bouquet of artificial flowers on
  his left arm, upon the summit of which the initials of the bride and
  bridegroom quivered in long tinsel sprays.</p>

  <p>Looking at this handsome young brother and sister standing side by
  side in <span class="pagenum">[pg 448]</span> bridal array, we could
  not help wondering privately whether a certain good and pretty young
  Madel, whose brother possessed neighboring acres and fat
  mountain-pastures, came into Anton&#39;s head at that moment as a
  Madel whom it would be a right and a pleasant thing to go to church
  with, he and she in similar or perhaps more modern costumes; and
  whether our comely Moidel thought it no sin to let her heart flutter
  off into a little romance of its own under that bridal stomacher.
  Still, even should our pseudo bride and bridegroom each indulge in a
  rapid day-dream, it must quickly come to an end, seeing that they
  have speedily to put off their fancy attire and attend that night to
  the flax-dressing.</p>

  <p>Oh, the constant care and trouble which the little flax-plant
  occasions! In August it had been cut and hung to dry in small bundles
  on stakes. It had thus been left out several weeks. Then in September
  it had been carried to the barn and the seed beaten out like corn and
  stowed away, the empty little husks being given to the hens and the
  voracious pig. The stalks&#8212;<i>hairs</i>, as Anton called
  them&#8212;were again carried to the field, and spread this time on
  the ground, neither too thick nor too thin, so that sun and moon
  could shine through them, and alternate rain and sun could rot them.
  The sooner the stalks decay and the fibres are loosened, the sooner
  the &quot;hairs&quot; can be carried to the kiln. This busy time had
  now come.</p>

  <p>In many places an oblong-shaped brick pit, half under ground, but
  often at the top, is used. The people of Edelsheim, however, stuck by
  preference to a deserted stone hut belonging to the parish, which,
  standing alone, could not, when used as a kiln, set fire to other
  houses. The night between Sunday and Monday was the time appointed
  for the Hof flax to be dried; so Moidel, Anton and the two
  Nannis&#8212;the <i>grossdirn</i> and the <i>kleindirn</i> in
  household parlance&#8212;carried it down to the hut, where old
  Traudl, a village crone and the parochial &quot;hair-dryer,&quot; had
  already made the vast oven red hot with a load of wood. Moidel and
  the servant-girls acting as the flax-dressers, the <i>grummelfuhr</i>
  spread the flax on planks in the furnace-like room, and returned home
  with cheerful steps. Through the dead hours of the night a silent
  watcher sat at the closed hut door. It was no other than Moro: he
  had, as usual, attended Moidel to the spot and noticed the
  proceedings. This she remembered clearly afterward, when in the
  morning, returning to her labors, he greeted her half reproachfully
  yet full of affection, as much as to say he had been quietly
  rectifying any short-comings on her part. All that day, whilst the
  industrious <i>grummelfuhr</i> hackled and received good cheer in the
  form of krapfen, for hackling is hard work, Moro attended in the
  character of a kind but strict overseer. Let us hope that when the
  fairies sat spinning in the stube in the twilight between last
  Christmas and Epiphany they amply rewarded Moro with an unlimited
  supply of magic bones, for did he not to the best of his ability help
  to make the flax &quot;white as chalk, soft as silk and long as the
  ship&#39;s sail&quot;?</p>

  <p>A mild excitement reigned in the Hof about the return of the
  cattle, and it was confided to us that Jakob greatly hoped that we
  should still be at Edelsheim to witness the triumphal entry. The
  bitter cold and rain, however, whilst it made it a necessity for us
  to leave, impeded the downward journey from the Eder Olm, which was
  still further retarded by Zottel, the new queen, not taking as
  cleverly to her dignity as Jakob had in the first instance fondly
  imagined.</p>

  <p>Thus, there was nothing for it but to fix the day of departure,
  besides having in readiness the parting gifts and surprises intended
  for each member of the worthy family. Such farewell occupations had,
  however, been long in progress, for it required great management,
  labor and forethought to hit on the right thing, and have it ready,
  with only the resources of a very small town. The handsome
  chromo-lithographs had been smuggled to the stationer&#39;s, and
  framed for the embellishment of the great sitting-room; the snuff-box
  for the Hofbauer <span class="pagenum">[pg 449]</span> the pipe and
  beer-mug for Onkel Johann, the satin kerchiefs for Kathi and Moidel,
  were all ready and ticketed; so were the neckties and tobacco-pouches
  for Anton and Jakob, when a bright idea struck E&#8212;&#8212;. She
  would subscribe for the illustrated <i>Alpenfreund</i>, to afford
  reading in the stube in the long snowy winter evenings. There was no
  time to be lost: the next day we were leaving; so, the rain having
  ceased, we started for the town to pay the subscription.</p>

  <p>We knew that it was two o&#39;clock as we crossed the fields, by
  the bell of the Capuchin monastery tolling for vespers: at the same
  moment the metallic, rattling sound of cattle-bells mixing with the
  ringing, and the sight of the peasants leaving their work and running
  in the direction of the high-road, told us that a herd of cattle was
  returning from the mountains. Other bells immediately became audible
  in the contrary direction, the tinkling and rattling continued, and
  just as we reached the shrine the two triumphant processions met. The
  one approaching from the west was headed by a very queen of Sheba.
  What a golden heart-shaped bell clanged from her proud neck! What a
  tall, beautiful crown, shining like a great sun in a bed of crimson
  ribbons, blazed on her head! Her little princess-calf, adorned with
  streamers, followed close at her regal heels: her courtiers attended
  in regular order in their purple and fine linen, or, in other words,
  their grand red-and-orange collars and their ponderous bells. When
  the queen saw the advancing herd she turned round her ample forehead
  and gave a significant low, bidding her attendants imitate her. And
  then, whilst the senners and herdsmen looked evidently fearful of an
  encounter between the two factions, she steadily but defiantly
  maintained the middle of the road, forcing by her lofty airs the
  other queen, who was young and inexperienced, to slink ignominiously
  into the ditch; so that after the proud conquering herd had swept on,
  she was with difficulty brought into the road and induced to proceed
  at the head of her literally <i>cowed</i> followers. It was but an
  illustration of what may often be seen in society, when some proud,
  overbearing chaperone at the head of her party sweeps past some
  pretty, shy young woman.</p>

  <p>The high-road was reported to be wonderfully lively with cattle
  this afternoon; consequently we came upon Onkel Johann, that most
  experienced man in the stall, seated by another judge of cattle on a
  wall, wearing their very longest white aprons and bibs, so that they
  almost touched the ground. You could tell the Hansel&#39;s keen
  relish of the spectacle by his mustering courage to urge our staying,
  since the great Jagdhaus herd belonging to the Sterniwitz (landlord
  of the Star) was approaching. We therefore lingered, and thus saw the
  beautiful herd. It had suffered from no cruel phantom this year.
  There were senners and herdsmen in their holiday costumes, with
  flowers and ribbons in their hats; there were leiterwagen returning
  with the chests of clothes and the now empty meal-sacks; but more
  than this, there were four pretty little lads, each leading the
  bonniest, cleanest little calf ever seen. What, however, made Onkel
  Johann rub his hands with glee and give a big chuckle was the sight
  of a great black ox, wearing, instead of the usual verdant wreath
  round its neck, a real cow&#39;s crown. It was as ludicrous in his
  eyes as the sight of some sober gentleman in a Parisian bonnet would
  be in ours. Such jokes seemed rife amongst the senners, for later on
  another black ox, in a fresh but smaller herd, tramped along with a
  rosette of scarlet ribbon on its head. The herdsman, seeing us smile,
  adjusted the ends as carefully as a lady&#39;s maid would put the
  last finishing-touches to the toilet of her mistress. That was the
  final stroke to Hansel&#39;s hilarity.</p>

  <p>That night the presents were given amidst endless expressions of
  surprise and affectionate gratitude, which were brought to a climax
  by E&#8212;&#39;s kind mother presenting Kathi with a pair of china
  vases adorned with carefully painted clusters of flowers. They
  brought great tears of admiration into the good soul&#39;s eyes. She
  vowed she would treasure <span class="pagenum">[pg 450]</span> them
  as long as she lived, and then they should be Moidel&#39;s. As soon
  as our plots were revealed, we found that counterplots had been
  carried on by the Hof family. Thus, Jakob had managed a clandestine
  journey from the Olm to Bruneck, and met Anton there, where they had
  both been photographed expressly for the Herrschaft, occasioning
  Anton to blush up to the roots of his hair when he, with a smile on
  his slightly pathetic face, presented each of us, as he said, with
  &quot;a very humble <i>Andenken</i>&quot;. Thus, too, a great many
  flowers with which to laden us had been carefully tended through this
  inclement season. The next morning, carrying away flowers and good
  wishes, and filled with thoughts of mingled pleasure and pain, we
  bade adieu to the quaint, quiet pastoral Hof, to arrive at nightfall
  in the fortified Italian city of Verona.</p>

  <h2>LAURENTINUM.</h2>

  <p>If anybody ever could have enjoyed living in heathen times, it
  must have been Pliny the Younger. A friend of ours calls him the
  gentlemanly letter writer, and so he was. He wrote letters which must
  have been treats to his correspondents. It is well that some of his
  notes did not require answers, for, as the letters of &quot;the
  parties of the second part&quot; are irretrievably lost, the
  annoyance one feels over a one-sided record is somewhat abated. Only
  the imperial replies are preserved. But, as we have said, Caius
  Plinius Caecilius Secundus (nephew to the ponderously fat and still
  more ponderously learned C. Plinius Secundus, who, like Leibnitz in
  latter times, sat, wrote, was read to, slept, and ate in his
  arm-chair for days together) must have enjoyed living. If he had not
  had so gentle a disposition and so loving a recollection of his
  uncle, we might have fancied him terribly bored by that worthy; for
  the elder Pliny was a <i>heluo miraculorum</i>, believing in and
  jotting down everything he heard, saw or read, like the immortal Mr.
  Pickwick. A book or a reader was ever at his elbow&#8212;a tablet or
  parchment ever within reach. And all this was undertaken or done for
  his nephew&#39;s advantage. There could have been but little pleasure
  in having such a guardian, though the nephew&#39;s easy, loving
  temper and delicate constitution caused him to be petted a good deal.
  A lucky dyspepsia (the Romans must have had the dyspepsia from eating
  the messes their Greek cooks put upon their tables) spared him from
  continuous attendance upon his uncle&#39;s studies. Then, too, Pliny
  was under his uncle&#39;s charge only for a few years, for Pliny the
  Elder lost his life in the famous eruption of Vesuvius. He was lord
  high admiral of the Mediterranean west of Italy; and of course when
  the eruption was reported at Misenum, at the admiralty-house, he must
  needs view it. It was too remarkable a thing not to have a high place
  in his <i>Natural History</i>. He ordered out his light galley. The
  rest we all know&#8212;how the admiral was as brave as he was fat,
  and seeing the danger in which so many friends with whom he had often
  supped were put, attempted to help some of them. So, because of the
  widow Rectina and his good friend Pomponianus, he came to his sad
  death.</p>

  <p>It was not so very great a loss to his nephew, now turned of
  eighteen&#8212;a likely youth, of course well connected, and now his
  uncle&#39;s heir. Caius Pliny went through the steps of the civil
  service with credit to himself, though his advancement was checked
  during Domitian&#39;s reign. He was indeed a consul, but then many
  consuls were appointed during the year. But it was much more prudent
  for him to keep quiet. He had a good practice&#8212;for this, though
  not strictly accurate, is the nearest term by which to designate his
  legal employment&#8212;and, to take a leap beyond the time we are
  speaking of, he was about twenty-five years afterward governor of
  Bithynia, whence he wrote his famous letter to the emperor Trajan
  about the Christians in his province. Of this letter much has been
  said, but we think that Pliny has not always been rightly judged
  about it. He was too conservative a man to be a persecutor, but was
  not much above or beyond his own time. And he wrote of the Christians
  as being a <i>religio illicita</i>&#8212;an illegal assembly of
  heretics&#8212;as regarded the state religion, which it was his duty
  to defend. It was wrong to persecute the Christians&#8212;wrong on
  general principles, wrong on particular axioms. But, alas! it has
  taken nearly seventeen more centuries of fiercer persecutors than
  Pliny proved to be to learn this little fact. All this is, as he
  would have said, <i>obiter</i>&#8212;by the way. It has, however, a
  good deal to do indirectly with his good living; for, as we were
  saying, C.P.C. Secundus <span class="pagenum">[pg 452]</span> lived
  very well indeed&#8212;not extravagantly, but comfortably.</p>

  <p>Now, to live well or comfortably, it is needful to have something
  wherewith to live thus comfortably. The start which C.P. Secundus
  gave C.P.C. Secundus lifted him up into a successful lawyer, a sort
  of public orator. As heir to his uncle&#39;s estate, and as coheir to
  estates of deceased friends, and as a public man, he amassed
  considerable property. He could undoubtedly&#8212;and we undoubtingly
  believe he did&#8212;do this with scrupulous honesty. His fees,
  salaries and legacies he took pains to earn. Legacies he claimed as
  they were left him, though he stooped to no fawning to obtain them,
  and in at least one instance returned the property to the natural
  (though he says undeserving) heir. If so, let us give him due credit
  for generosity. Certainly, he was not selfish or illiberal. He
  assisted his friends with money and influence, as well as advice, and
  he gave to his native town, Comum, a public library, besides an
  endowment of three hundred thousand sesterces ($12,000) yearly for
  ever to maintain children born of free parents. How long this
  endowment lasted we cannot say, but it must, at any rate, have
  disappeared in the dilapidations caused three hundred and fifty years
  afterward by the Gothic invaders of Italy. Then he had two villas at
  least, besides his town-house, with slaves, attendants and following
  to match. This will suffice to show that he had the wherewithal. But
  could he enjoy it? He was a literary man: his uncle had settled that
  for him. He was an oratorical light in the Senate. His letters show
  that he was a gentleman, whose delicacy of feeling was as fine as the
  lauded courtesies of modern times. As proof that he was a gentleman,
  and that he knew how to distinguish a good from a poor dinner, and as
  proof, too, of the good advice he was wont to give away as freely as
  good money, we will put in his letter to Avitus upon occasion of a
  dinner he had just attended:</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Cains Pliny to his own Avitus, greeting</i>: It would
  take too long, and do no good, to tell you how, though not on
  familiar terms, I came to dine with a man who piques himself upon his
  elegant and correct, though sordid and profuse, entertainments. They
  are so in this: he placed before the select few some rare
  delicacies&#8212;before the rest he put indifferent or little food.
  Even of the wine there were but three sorts, and these, besides, in
  little flagons&#8212;evidently not that you should choose&quot; but
  to prevent your choosing&#8212;one sort for himself and us, another
  for his poorer friends, a third for his and our freedmen. A neighbor
  on the same couch asked me what I thought of it: Did I approve?
  &#39;No.&#39; &#39;Then what is your rule?&#39; &#39;I put the same
  things before all my guests, for I ask them to sup, not to grade them
  in my esteem: I equalize in all things those I invite to my
  table.&#39; &#39;Even the freedmen?&#39; &#39;Yes, for then they are
  my guests, and not freedmen.&#39; He replied,&#39; It must cost you a
  good deal.&#39; &#39;Very little.&#39; &#39;How so?&#39; &#39;Thus: I
  drink then what my freedmen drink, not they my wines.&#39; And truly,
  if you will but restrain your taste a little, it is not hard to join
  in drinking with the many at your table. To be sure, fastidious taste
  must be repressed, and, as it were, brought under control, if you
  spare that expense in which one consults rather his own gratification
  than the feelings of others. But why all this? I write, so that the
  luxury of some under the specious guise of economy may not impose
  upon you as a well-disposed youth. And so, out of pure good-will to
  you, I draw instances from my experience to advise or warn you. There
  is nothing to be more carefully avoided than that upstart society
  compounded of meanness and luxury, for these twain, bad enough apart,
  are abominable when joined together. Vale!&quot;</p>

  <p>Now, gentle reader, yourself being judge, we submit to your honor
  that here are good sense, delicate taste and refinement combined. Two
  things also must be noted: First, we are glad to find that the
  well-disposed youth to whom we were introduced in Mr. Adams&#39;s
  <i>Latin Grammar</i> some twenty-odd years ago turns out to be this
  kindly <span class="pagenum">[pg 453]</span> young man in whom C.P.C.
  Secundus, Jr., takes such an interest: we are sure he is a deserving
  young man, and will turn out a brilliant diner-out; only it would
  have been more ingenuous in Mr. Adams to have told us plainly that it
  was Avitus whose character was being formed by the famous C.P.C.
  Secundus, generally known as Pliny the Younger; and then we might
  have profited by the tuition. Again, the freedman was not one in the
  sense in which we use the term, but one who was emancipated and a
  member (not always a menial member) of his patron&#39;s family. The
  African as a slave had just begun to be a common servant in wealthy
  households, but the <i>libertus</i> was often of better blood than
  many a citizen. You will remember that Horace was the son of such a
  freedman. So again we hold it proven that Pliny knew how to enjoy his
  opportunities of good living&#8212;opportunities acquired partly by
  inheritance, partly by his ability and deserts. He had a
  well-balanced, self-poised character, and so could trust himself
  <i>temperare gulce</i>&#8212;to eat, drink and enjoy life
  temperately. He was tested in the troublous times of Domitian. By
  living quietly, by adroitly parrying pointed and dangerous questions,
  by avoiding public life, he managed to pass through a very difficult
  reign; for it was a difficult time under an emperor who spared not
  even flies: certainly it was the only way in which he ever battled
  with Beelzebub. Now we hold that had C.P.C. Secundus been anything
  beyond an amateur epicure&#8212;if he had been a
  <i>gourmand</i>&#8212;he would have fatally said or done something
  that would have prevented his ever writing any more letters to
  friends or to General Trajanus. To be a well-balanced eater is,
  <i>cceteris paribus</i>, to be a well-balanced man. Perhaps Pliny was
  too fastidious to be a proper epicure even&#8212;too fastidious in
  other directions, we mean. And he had learned some habits from his
  early training which would interfere materially with habitual
  attention to the pleasures of the table. But we protest we did not
  intend, even as a first object, to bring up the table as the main
  proof of Pliny&#39;s enjoyment of the good things of this life. We
  wanted to show you, courteous reader, something of how he lived, and
  it is necessary to learn his habits in order to decide whether he
  enjoyed the things which Providence had given him. He had learned of
  his uncle the bad habit of reading or of being read to at meal-times.
  He did not indulge in it, he says, when he had company, but only when
  his family was present. His protestation does not avail him: this
  plea rather aggravated the rudeness. For, however formal etiquette
  may be laid aside in the bosom of his family, a <i>paterfamilias</i>
  is none the less bound to observe the laws of courtesy. But it yet
  leads us to notice that C.P.C. loved his wife and children. His wife
  was the daughter of one Fabatus, who would most undoubtedly have been
  long since forgotten but that his son-in-law wrote him model letters,
  sometimes on business, sometimes on his health, sometimes about
  visits that had been delayed&#8212;generally complimentary, always
  short, always implying high reverence for the father of a well-loved
  wife. But he carried the family passion for reading to excess. One of
  his regrets is that his favorite reader is consumptive, and, despite
  a season in Egypt for his health, was still suffering. So he sends
  him to the country-seat of a friend, to see if the country air and
  good nursing will not restore him. It was an accomplishment to read
  well that added to the value of a slave, and Pliny prized his
  &quot;boy&quot; accordingly. This is but a slight indication of the
  excess to which he carried his love for reading and scribbling. If he
  could not read, he must scribble; so he scribbled when out hunting!
  If he had been fishing with a book in his hand, that had been
  excusable. But we do not believe that the Romans took kindly to
  fishing as a sport. They bred their fish in private
  fish-ponds&#8212;<i>piscinae</i>&#8212;and they had a revolting habit
  of fattening their fish. Old Izaak would have abhorred the very
  thought of casting a line for such prey: sickening thoughts of
  cannibalism would have filled him <span class="pagenum">[pg
  454]</span> with horror. But C.P.C. consented to hunt one day, so he
  writes to Tacitus. Did he ride after the dogs, spear in hand, to kill
  the fierce wild-boar? Not he. He; sat down by the nets with tablets
  on his knee, under the quiet shade, and meditated and enjoyed the
  solitude, and scribbled to his heart&#39;s content. Here a doubt
  arises. Let us whisper it: Did he inherit the avuncular tendency to
  obesity? We have seen no hint of this, and of course it would not
  enter into his correspondence; but it is possible. At all events, our
  natural conclusion is, that he was too literary to be merely a <i>bon
  vivant</i>. No, he was a shrewd reader of human nature, a man of rare
  taste, of strong sense, and fond of an equable life. He had means,
  and often, if not always, the proper leisure to live well. And by
  living well we mean, not that he indulged in a greedy enjoyment of
  the good things of this life, nor yet in a profuse and gaudy display,
  but that, being a heathen, he lived as an upright heathen lawyer,
  magistrate, statesman and millionaire should live.</p>

  <p>It was needful for him, then, having the wherewithal, and being a
  refined and well-balanced man, to have the place where to live well.
  Did he have this? Yes: he had two villas&#8212;one a summer residence
  near the mountains, and a winter one sixteen miles from Rome, near
  Laurentum. This was the villa of Laurentinum. It was fitted up with
  every then known comfort and convenience which a man of wealth,
  pleasure and taste could want and thoroughly enjoy. As he was fond of
  showing his winter-house, we may go back just seventeen hundred and
  eighty years and introduce you as his friend Gallus. It is so long
  since that Pliny would not detect you, and we shall have the benefit
  of his own guidance in the intricacies of his spacious villa. We will
  take his advice, and instead of traveling in the clumsy <i>rheda</i>
  over the sandy road, we will ride out on horseback. The views along
  the road are pretty&#8212;now in a woody skirt, now by meadows in
  which the sheep and cattle find a later pasturage than higher up the
  country; so, by a winding path, we come upon a roomy and hospitable
  villa. This is Laurentinum, near Laurentum. We come before the
  <i>atrium</i>: a slave announces us, and the courteous master
  welcomes us on the steps of a <i>porch</i> shaped like the letter D,
  with pleasant transparent mica windows, and roofed over as a
  protection against showers. Thence he ushers us into a cheerful
  entrance-hall: &quot;Let me show you my winter retreat. Your room is
  in rather a distant part of my little villa, and it is nearly time to
  bathe. Let me conduct you.&quot; We see that our friend is rather
  proud of his home, and so he ought to be, for we find it a snug
  retreat for a vacation. Now let us see when and how he enjoys himself
  after his labors in either of the courts. Let us follow him out of
  the hall into the dining-room, which has a pleasant southern outlook
  upon the sea. The murmuring waves echo in it. It has innumerable
  doors, and windows reaching to the floor, and is as pleasant as the
  banquet-room of the Americus Club-house. You look out upon, as it
  were, triple seas: so too from the atrium, the portico and the hall
  you can look over woods, hills or the sea. Through the hall again,
  into an ample chamber, then out to a smaller one, which lets in the
  rising sunlight on the one side and the purple glow of sunset on the
  other. Here, too, is a partial view of the sea. These rooms are
  protected from all but fair-weather winds. The great dining-room is
  the pleasant&#8212;weather room. Then next beyond is the apsidal
  chamber, which admits continuous sunshine through its many windows.
  Book-presses stand against the partition wall, to hold the books in
  constant use. &quot;My uncle, good Gallus, taught me not to lose an
  hour. Behind this is the dormitory, properly tempered according to
  the season: farther on are the servants&#39; and freedmen&#39;s
  apartments. But here is your room. After the bath we will see the
  rest. The bath is here between these cool dressing-rooms: you must
  need it after your dusty ride, my Gallus.</p>

  <p>&quot;My friend Spurenna lives pleasantly. I spent a few days with
  him not long ago. Early in the morning he takes a <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 455]</span> stroll of three miles. If he has visitors,
  he chats with them on some improving subject&#8212;if not, he reads.
  Then with books and conversation he fills up the interval till it is
  time to ride, when, with his wife and a friend or two&#8212;perhaps
  myself&#8212;he takes a drive of seven or eight miles. Till it is
  time to bathe he amuses us with his graceful lyrics, in Greek as well
  as in Latin. He bathes about two or three o&#39;clock, and then suns
  himself; for by bathing and rubbing and sunning he fights off the
  ills of advancing years. Then a lunch. Then dinner, which is served
  on antique solid silver. Have you enjoyed your bath, my Gallus? The
  tank is large enough, certainly, for one to swim in. Now, as we pass
  back, see how conveniently the bathing-house, heater and
  perfuming-rooms adjoin. Here are my fish-ponds: the poor things can
  look out upon the sea if they choose. And now my tennis-court, quite
  a warm place late in the afternoon. Here is a turret with two sunny
  rooms under it: that one yonder is a pleasant sunlit supper-room,
  with views of sea and beaches and villas. Yonder is the villa once
  owned by Hortensius, Cicero&#39;s great rival, you remember. It is
  not in good repair, and is rather old-fashioned too. A third turret
  has under it a large larder and store-room, and a spacious
  bed-chamber. In that sunny room, again, you can escape the crash of
  the surges, which only penetrates here as a gentle murmur. In truth,
  good Gallus, where there are so many wintry changes on a coast like
  this, I like to be able to change too. High winds and storms on a
  seashore compel us to have protected dining-rooms. This one we are
  now in looks out upon my garden and the shaded alley round it. We
  will dine early, and in the front triclinium this pleasant
  evening.... In the country here we have not all the delicacies that
  the city commands, but by the aid of Ostia and yonder village we
  manage tolerably.... Some wine? Falernian, that my good uncle bought
  forty years ago. The wax on the jar is stiff with age. There is
  nothing I delight in more than in gathering my wife and children
  around me, as you see. And I make you a member of my household at
  once by not laying aside my rule. My reader is hoarse to-day, or I
  would have some interesting extracts out of my uncle&#39;s notebook
  read. Some grapes? They are late October vines. We can look out of
  those side windows upon the white-sailed galleys that go by. My uncle
  was admiral of the western fleet, you know, and though I have only
  been a civil officer, yet I have a sort of love for the sea; and this
  is one thing that makes Laurentinum so dear to me. Have you dined so
  simply? Your ride has not given you the appetite it gives me. Fatigue
  is your true appetizer, and if that fails I cannot hope that these
  autumn figs will tempt you.&quot;</p>

  <p>Our host runs on thus at a great rate, and is evidently bent on
  showing us the rest of his comfortable villa before the daylight
  fails us:</p>

  <p>&quot;So you would see the retreat I claim as my own den? Let us
  pass back into the box-alley. The box does not grow well unless
  sheltered from the winds and the beating sunshine; so the gaps in the
  hedge I fill up with rosemary. You see that the inside of the alley
  is formed by vines. The shadowy, tender lawn under them is a pleasant
  place to walk on barefoot. The fig and mulberry are the only trees
  that grow well here. The garden is backed by two sunny rooms again,
  and behind that is the kitchen garden. And here is the long covered
  way near the public work. It has twice as many windows opening out as
  it has opposite opening into my garden, and on blowing as well as
  windless days the shutters are ever open. In front is my colonnade,
  fringed with violets. Here is my basking-walk. You see how it
  shelters one, too, from the African winds. It cuts off the wind from
  the other side in winter. It has advantages both for winter and
  summer: according to the season and the shade, you can enjoy the
  sea-view or can get the cool of the garden and alley. Then those open
  windows always keep the air astir. This summer-like place is my
  special delight, for I planned it myself.&quot;</p><span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 456]</span>

  <p>And indeed, my pseudo Gallus, let me remark that, being myself a
  native of the Mediterranean, I can enter better than you can into the
  childish delight that our friend Caius Plinius expresses. It is a joy
  which is not to be found in the nature of the American to sleep in
  the tropic heats of a July sun. Winter is abhorrent to the nature of
  every Levanter. To bask upon the shore of the Mediterranean, with the
  calm lazy sea at your feet and the winds cut off from your back, is
  the only decent way of hibernating. But this is in your ear as we
  pass along, and you will have to repress the smile on your lips or
  change it into a sign of courteous pleasure, or he will detect the
  impostor.</p>

  <p>Now then: &quot;Here is my sun-chamber. It looks out on the
  colonnade, the sea and the sunshine. It leads into the covered walk
  by this window, and into my bed-chamber by this door. But hither.
  Seaward there is a letter cabinet on the division wall. It is entered
  from the bed-chamber, and can be separated effectually by these
  curtains and this transparent door. You see it has only a lounge and
  a couple of arm-chairs. At your feet is the sea, behind you the
  house, over head the woods: windows look out on either side. My
  bed-room is convenient, and yet I am far from the babble of the
  household. Not the trampling of the waves, no sounds of storm, no
  flash of lightning, even daylight cannot penetrate here unless the
  shutters are opened. It is so secret and quiet and hidden because it
  is in the corridor between the bed-room walls and the garden wall,
  and so every sound is deadened. A small oven is added to the
  bed-chamber, which by this narrow opening admits heat when required.
  There lie the antechamber and the bed-room, which get the sun all the
  day long. What do you think of my den, my Gallus? When I betake
  myself to this retreat I seem to have left my home behind me; and
  especially in the Saturnalia I delight in it. When the rest of the
  house is given up to the license of noisy festivals, no noises can
  disturb my reveries, no clamors interfere with my studies.&quot;</p>

  <p>Let us express our admiration of so well-appointed an abode with
  cautious terms, and let us say that we might wonder if any one could
  help longing for such a home. Let us be careful that we do not betray
  ourselves by asking after modern improvements, as you, O Mask, might
  do, but you are not house-hunting to-day.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, this is comfortable and delightful, but it has one
  drawback. There is no spring in the whole enclosure; but we try to
  make up for it by wells, or rather fountains. But along this
  wonderful shore you have only to dig a little and there oozes out at
  once&#8212;I cannot call it water, a humor rather, which is
  unsophisticated brine, on account of the sea so near by, I suppose.
  Those forests supply us with wood: Ostia supplies us with everything
  else that cannot be got in yonder village. You see how I live and
  enjoy myself, and you must be a very ingrained cit indeed if you do
  not instantly decide to settle down amongst us. There is a little
  farm not far off: let me negotiate it for you.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is time for us to vanish, for he will next propose to buy the
  Hortensian villa from the improvident prodigal who holds it, and will
  make you settle down here in spite of yourself, and so make a
  respectable heathen out of you; for of course you have not the
  courage to whisper in his ear that you are a Christian: his oven is
  not yet cooled down.</p>

  <p>But now own, as we are back in the nineteenth century without a
  single hair singed, does not C.P.C. Secundus live well as a man who
  is upright, just, loving his family, honoring and serving the
  emperor, attending to his own business and enjoying his vacations in
  a gentlemanly way, though he will become a heathen persecutor before
  he dies?</p>

  <h3>EXCHANGES.</h3>

  <p>Just as Frank Lavender went down stairs to meet Ingram, a letter
  which had been forwarded from London was brought to Sheila. It bore
  the Lewis postmark, and she guessed it was from Duncan, for she had
  told Mairi to ask the tall keeper to write, and she knew he would
  hasten to obey her request at any sacrifice of comfort to himself.
  Sheila sat down to read the letter in a happy frame of mind. She had
  every confidence that all her troubles were about to be removed now
  that her good friend Ingram had come to her husband; and here was a
  message to her from her home that seemed, even before she read it, to
  beg of her to come thither light-hearted and joyous. This was what
  she read:</p>

  <blockquote>
    &quot;BORVABOST, THE ISLAND OF LEWS, &quot;<i>the third Aug</i>.,
    18&#8212;&#8212;.

    <p>&quot;HONORED MRS. LAVENDER,&#8212;It waz Mairi waz sayin that
    you will want me to write to you, bit I am not good at the writen
    whatever, and it was 2 years since I was writen to Amerika, to John
    Ferkason that kept the tea-shop in Stornoway, and was trooned in
    coming home the verra last year before this. It waz Mairi will say
    you will like a letter as well as any one that waz goin to Amerika,
    for the news and the things, and you will be as far away from us as
    if you waz living in Amerika or Glaska. But there is not much news,
    for the lads they hev all pulled up the boats, and they are away to
    Wick, and Sandy McDougal that waz living by Loch Langavat, he will
    be going too, for he was up at the sheilings when Mrs.
    Paterson&#39;s lasses waz there with the cows, and it waz Jeanie
    the youngest and him made it up, and he haz twenty-five pounds in
    the bank, which is a good thing too mirover for the young couple.
    It was many a one waz sayin when the cows and the sheep waz come
    home from the sheilings that never afore waz Miss Sheila away from
    Loch Roag when the cattle would be swimmin across the loch to the
    island; and I will say to many of them verra well you will wait and
    you will see Miss Sheila back again in the Lews, and it wazna
    allwas you would lif away from your own home where you was born and
    the people will know you from the one year to the next. John
    McNicol of Habost he will be verra bad three months or two months
    ago, and we waz thinkin he will die, and him with a wife and five
    bairns too, and four cows and a cart, but the doctor took a great
    dale of blood from him, and he is now verra well whatever, though
    wakely on the legs. It would hev been a bad thing if Mr. McNicol
    waz dead, for he will be verra good at pentin a door, and he haz
    between fifteen pounds and ten pounds in the bank at Stornoway, and
    four cows too and a cart, and he is a ferra religious man, and has
    great skill o&#39; the psalm-tunes, and he toesna get trunk now
    more as twice or as three times in the two weeks. It was his
    dochter Betsy, a verra fine lass, that waz come to Borvabost, and
    it waz the talk among many that Alister-nan-Each he waz thinkin of
    makin up to her, but there will be a great laugh all over the
    island, and she will be verra angry and say she will not have him
    no if his house had a door of silfer to it for she will have no one
    that toesna go to the Caithness fishins wi the other lads. It waz
    blew verra hard here the last night or two or three. There is a
    great deal of salmon in the rivers; and Mr. Mackenzie he will be
    going across to Grimersta, the day after to-morrow, or the next day
    before that, and the English gentlemen have been there more as two
    or three weeks, and they will be getting verra good sport whatever.
    Mairi she will be writen a letter to you to-morrow, Miss Sheila,
    and she will be <span class="pagenum">[pg 458]</span> telling you
    all the news of the house. Mairi waz sayin she will be goin to
    London when the harvest was got in, and Scarlett will say to her
    that no one will let her land on the island again if she toesna
    bring you back with her to the island and to your own house. If it
    waz not too much trouble, Miss Sheila, it would be a proud day for
    Scarlett if you waz send me a line or two lines to say if you will
    be coming to the Lews this summer or before the winter is over
    whatever. I remain, Honored Mrs. Lavender, your obedient
    servant,</p>&quot;DUNCAN MACDONALD.&quot;
  </blockquote>

  <p>&quot;This summer or winter,&quot; said Sheila to herself, with a
  happy light on her face: &quot;why not now?&quot; Why should she not
  go down stairs to the coffee-room of the hotel and place this
  invitation in the hand of her husband and his friend? Would not its
  garrulous simplicity recall to both of them the island they used to
  find so pleasant? Would not they suddenly resolve to leave behind
  them London and its ways and people, even this monotonous sea out
  there, and speed away northwardly till they came in sight of the
  great and rolling Minch, with its majestic breadth of sky and its
  pale blue islands lying far away at the horizon? Then the happy
  landing at Stornoway&#8212;her father and Duncan and Mairi all on the
  quay&#8212;the rapid drive over to Loch Roag, and the first glimpse
  of the rocky bays and clear water and white sand about Borva and
  Borvabost! And Sheila would once more&#8212;having cast aside this
  cumbrous attire that she had to change so often, and having got out
  that neat and simple costume that was so good for walking or driving
  or sailing&#8212;be proud to wait upon her guests, and help Mairi in
  her household ways, and have a pretty table ready for the gentlemen
  when they returned from the shooting.</p>

  <p>Her husband came up the hotel stairs and entered the room. She
  rose to meet him, with the open letter in her hand.</p>

  <p>&quot;Sheila,&quot; he said (and the light slowly died away from
  her face), &quot;I have something to ask of you.&quot;</p>

  <p>She knew by the sound of his voice that she had nothing to hope:
  it was not the first time she had been disappointed, and yet this
  time it seemed especially bitter somehow. The awakening from these
  illusions was sudden.</p>

  <p>She did not answer, so he said in the same measured voice, &quot;I
  have to ask that you will have henceforth no communication with Mr.
  Ingram: I do not wish him to come to the house.&quot;</p>

  <p>She stood for a moment, apparently not understanding the meaning
  of what he said. Then, when the full force of this decision and
  request came upon her, a quick color sprang to her face, the cause of
  which, if it had been revealed to him in words, would have
  considerably astonished her husband. But that moment of doubt, of
  surprise and of inward indignation was soon over. She cast down her
  eyes and said meekly, &quot;Very well, dear.&quot;</p>

  <p>It was now his turn to be astonished, and mortified as well. He
  could not have believed it possible that she should so calmly
  acquiesce in the dismissal of one of her dearest friends. He had
  expected a more or less angry protest, if not a distinct refusal,
  which would have given him an opportunity for displaying the injuries
  he conceived himself to have suffered at their hands. Why had she not
  come to himself? This man Ingram was presuming on his ancient
  friendship, and on the part he had taken in forwarding the marriage
  up in Borva. He had always, moreover, been somewhat too much of the
  schoolmaster, with his severe judgments, his sententious fashion of
  criticising and warning people, and his readiness to prove the whole
  world wrong in order to show himself to be right. All these and many
  other things Lavender meant to say to Sheila so soon as she had
  protested against his forbidding Ingram to come any more to the
  house. But there was no protest. Sheila did not even seem surprised.
  She went back to her seat by the window, folded up Duncan&#39;s
  letter and put it in her pocket; and then she turned to look at the
  sea.</p>

  <p>Lavender regarded her for a moment, <span class="pagenum">[pg
  459]</span> apparently doubting whether he should himself prosecute
  the subject: then he turned and left the room.</p>

  <p>Sheila did not cry or otherwise seek to compassionate and console
  herself. Her husband had told her to do a certain thing, and she
  would do it. Perhaps she had been imprudent in having confided in Mr.
  Ingram, and if so, it was right that she should be punished. But the
  regret and pain that lay deep in her heart were that Ingram should
  have suffered through her, and that she had no opportunity of telling
  him that, though they might not see each other, she would never
  forget her friendship for him, or cease to be grateful to him for his
  unceasing and generous kindness to her.</p>

  <p>Next morning Lavender was summoned to London by a telegram which
  announced that his aunt was seriously ill. He and Sheila got ready at
  once, left by a forenoon train, had some brief luncheon at home, and
  then went down to see the old lady in Kensington Gore. During their
  journey Lavender had been rather more courteous and kindly toward
  Sheila than was his wont. Was he pleased that she had so readily
  obeyed him in this matter of giving up about the only friend she had
  in London? or was he moved by some visitation of compunction? Sheila
  tried to show that she was grateful for his kindness, but there was
  that between them which could not be removed by chance phrases or
  attentions.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lavender was in her own room. Paterson brought word that she
  wanted to see Sheila first and alone; so Lavender sat down in the
  gloomy drawing-room by the window, and watched the people riding and
  driving past, and the sunshine on the dusty green trees in the
  Park.</p>

  <p>&quot;Is Frank Lavender below?&quot; said the thin old woman, who
  was propped up in bed, with some scarlet garment around her that made
  her resemble more than ever the cockatoo of which Sheila had thought
  on first seeing her. &quot;Yes,&quot; said Sheila. &quot;I want to
  see you alone: I can&#39;t bear him dawdling about a room, and
  staring at things, and saying nothing. Does he speak to
  you?&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila did not wish to enter into any controversy about the habits
  of her husband, so she said, &quot;I hope you will see him before he
  goes, Mrs. Lavender. He is very anxious to know how you are, and I am
  glad to find you looking so well. You do not look like an invalid at
  all.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m not going to die yet,&quot; said the little
  dried old woman with the harsh voice, the staring eyes and the
  tightly-twisted gray hair. &quot;I hope you didn&#39;t come to read
  the Bible to me: you wouldn&#39;t find one about in any case, I
  should think. If you like to sit down and read the sayings of the
  emperor Marcus Antoninus, I should enjoy that; but I suppose you are
  too busy thinking what dress you&#39;ll wear at my funeral.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Indeed, I was thinking of no such thing,&quot; said Sheila
  indignantly, but feeling all the same that the hard, glittering,
  expressionless eyes were watching her.</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you think I believe you?&quot; said Mrs. Lavender.
  &quot;Bah! I hope I am able to recognize the facts of life. If you
  were to die this afternoon, I should get a black silk trimmed with
  crape the moment I got on my feet again, and go to your funeral in
  the ordinary way. I hope you will pay me the same respect. Do you
  think I am afraid to speak of these things?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why should you speak of them?&quot; said Sheila
  despairingly.</p>

  <p>&quot;Because it does you good to contemplate the worst that can
  befall you, and if it does not happen you may rejoice. And it will
  happen. I know I shall be lying in this bed, with half a dozen of you
  round about trying to cry, and wondering which will have the courage
  to turn and go out of the room first. Then there will be the funeral
  day, and Paterson will be careful about the blinds, and go about the
  house on her tiptoes, as if I were likely to hear! Then there will be
  a pretty service up in the cemetery, and a man who never saw me will
  speak of his dear sister departed; and then you&#39;ll all go home
  and have your dinner. Am I afraid of it?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why should you talk like that?&quot; said <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 460]</span> Sheila piteously. &quot;You are not going
  to die. You distress yourself and others by thinking of these
  horrible things.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear child, there is nothing horrible in nature.
  Everything is part of the universal system which you should recognize
  and accept. If you had but trained yourself now, by the study of
  philosophical works, to know how helpless you are to alter the facts
  of life, and how it is the best wisdom to be prepared for the worst,
  you would find nothing horrible in thinking of your own funeral. You
  are not looking well.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila was startled by the suddenness of the announcement:
  &quot;Perhaps I am a little tired with the traveling we have done
  to-day.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Is Frank Lavender kind to you?&quot; What was she to say
  with those two eyes scanning her face? &quot;It is too soon to expect
  him to be anything else,&quot; she said with an effort at a
  smile.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah! So you are beginning to talk in that way? I thought you
  were full of sentimental notions of life when you came to London. It
  is not a good place for nurturing such things.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is not,&quot; said Sheila, surprised into a sigh.</p>

  <p>&quot;Come nearer. Don&#39;t be afraid I shall bite you. I am not
  so ferocious as I look.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila rose and went closer to the bedside, and the old woman
  stretched out a lean and withered hand to her: &quot;If I thought
  that that silly fellow wasn&#39;t behaving well to
  you&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I will not listen to you,&quot; said Sheila, suddenly
  withdrawing her hand, while a quick color leapt to her
  face&#8212;&quot;I will not listen to you if you speak of my husband
  in that way.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I will speak of him any way I like. Don&#39;t get into a
  rage. I have known Frank Lavender a good deal longer than you have.
  What I was going to say is this&#8212;that if I thought that he was
  not behaving well to you, I would play him a trick. I would leave my
  money, which is all he has got to live on, to you; and when I died he
  would find himself dependent on you for every farthing he wanted to
  spend.&quot;</p>

  <p>And the old woman laughed, with very little of the weakness of an
  invalid in the look of her face. But Sheila, when she had mastered
  her surprise and resolved not be angry, said calmly, &quot;Whatever I
  have, whatever I might have, that belongs to my husband, not to
  me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Now you speak like a sensible girl,&quot; said Mrs.
  Lavender. &quot;That is the misfortune of a wife, that she cannot
  keep her own money to herself. But there are means by which the law
  may be defeated, my dear. I have been thinking it over&#8212;I have
  been speaking of it to Mr. Ingram; for I have suspected for some time
  that my nephew, Mr. Frank, was not behaving himself.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Mrs. Lavender,&quot; said Sheila, with a face too proud and
  indignant for tears, &quot;you do not understand me. No one has the
  right to imagine anything against my husband and to seek to punish
  him through me. And when I said that everything I have belongs to
  him, I was not thinking of the law&#8212;no&#8212;but only this: that
  everything I have, or might have, would belong to him, as I myself
  belong to him of my own free will and gift; and I would have no money
  or anything else that was not entirely his.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You are a fool.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Sheila, struggling to repress her
  tears.</p>

  <p>&quot;What if I were to leave every farthing of my property to a
  hospital? Where would Frank Lavender be then?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He could earn his own living without any such help,&quot;
  said Sheila proudly; for she had never yet given up the hope that her
  husband would fulfill the fair promise of an earlier time, and win
  great renown for himself in striving to please her, as he had many a
  time vowed he would do.</p>

  <p>&quot;He has taken great care to conceal his powers in that
  way,&quot; said the old woman with a sneer.</p>

  <p>&quot;And if he has, whose fault is it?&quot; the girl said
  warmly. &quot;Who has kept him in idleness but yourself? And now you
  blame him for it. I wish he had never had any of your money&#8212;I
  wish he were never to have any more of it.&quot;</p><span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 461]</span>

  <p>And then Sheila stopped, with a terrible dread falling over her.
  What had she not said? The pride of her race had carried her so far,
  and she had given expression to all the tumult of her heart; but had
  she not betrayed her duty as a wife, and grievously compromised the
  interests of her husband? And yet the indignation in her bosom was
  too strong to admit of her retracting those fatal phrases and begging
  forgiveness. She stood for a moment irresolute, and she knew that the
  invalid was regarding her curiously, as though she were some wild
  animal, and not an ordinary resident in Bayswater.</p>

  <p>&quot;You are a little mad, but you are a good girl, and I want to
  be friends with you. You have in you the spirit of a dozen Frank
  Lavenders.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You will never make friends with me by speaking ill of my
  husband,&quot; said Sheila with the same proud and indignant
  look.</p>

  <p>&quot;Not when he ill uses you?&quot; &quot;He does not ill use
  me. What has Mr. Ingram been saying to you?&quot;</p>

  <p>The sudden question would certainly have brought about a
  disclosure if any were to have been made; but Mrs. Lavender assured
  Sheila that Mr. Ingram had told her nothing, that she had been
  forming her own conclusions, and that she still doubted that they
  were right.</p>

  <p>&quot;Now sit down and read to me. You will find Marcus Antoninus
  on the top of those books.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Frank is in the drawing-room,&quot; observed Sheila
  mildly.</p>

  <p>&quot;He can wait,&quot; said the old woman sharply.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, but you cannot expect me to keep him waiting,&quot;
  with a smile which did not conceal her very definite purpose.</p>

  <p>&quot;Then ring, and bid him come up. You will soon get rid of
  those absurd sentiments.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila rang the bell, and sent Mrs. Paterson down for Lavender,
  but she did not betake herself to Marcus Antoninus. She waited a few
  minutes, and then her husband made his appearance, whereupon she sat
  down and left to him the agreeable duty of talking with this
  toothless old heathen about funerals and lingering death.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, Aunt Lavender, I am sorry to hear you have been ill,
  but I suppose you are getting all right again, to judge by your
  looks.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am not nearly as ill as you expected.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I wonder you did not say &#39;hoped,&#39;&quot; remarked
  Lavender carelessly. &quot;You are always attributing the most
  charitable feelings to your fellow-creatures.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Frank Lavender,&quot; said the old lady, who was a little
  pleased by this bit of flattery, &quot;if you came here to make
  yourself impertinent and disagreeable, you can go down stairs again.
  Your wife and I get on very well without you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am glad to hear it,&quot; he said: &quot;I suppose you
  have been telling her what is the matter with you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I have not. I don&#39;t know. I have had a pain in the head
  and two fits, and I dare say the next will carry me off. The doctors
  won&#39;t tell me anything about it, so I suppose it is
  serious.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; cried Lavender. &quot;Serious! To look at
  you, one would say you never had been ill in your life.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t tell stories, Frank Lavender. I know I look like a
  corpse, but I don&#39;t mind it, for I avoid the looking-glass and
  keep the spectacle for my friends. I expect the next fit will kill
  me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what it is, Aunt Lavender: if you would
  only get up and come with us for a drive in the Park, you would find
  there was nothing of an invalid about you; and we should take you
  home to a quiet dinner at Notting Hill, and Sheila would sing to you
  all the evening, and to-morrow you would receive the doctors in state
  in your drawing-rooms, and tell them you were going for a month to
  Malvern.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Your husband has a fine imagination, my dear,&quot; said
  Mrs. Lavender to Sheila. &quot;It is a pity he puts it to no use. Now
  I shall let both of you go. Three breathing in this room are too many
  for the cubic feet of air it contains. Frank, bring over those scales
  and put them on the table, and send Paterson to me as you go
  out.&quot;</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 462]</span>

  <p>And so they went down stairs and out of the house. Just as they
  stood on the steps, looking for a hansom, a young lad came forward
  and shook hands with Lavender, glancing rather nervously at
  Sheila.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, Mosenberg,&quot; said Lavender, &quot;you&#39;ve come
  back from Leipsic at last? We got your card when we came home this
  morning from Brighton. Let me introduce you to my wife.&quot;</p>

  <p>The boy looked at the beautiful face before him with something of
  distant wonder and reverence in his regard. Sheila had heard of the
  lad before&#8212;of the Mendelssohn that was to be&#8212;and liked
  his appearance at first sight. He was a rather handsome boy of
  fourteen or fifteen, of the fair Jew type, with large, dark,
  expressive eyes, and long, wavy, light-brown hair. He spoke English
  fluently and well: his slight German accent was, indeed, scarcely so
  distinct as Sheila&#39;s Highland one, the chief peculiarity of his
  speaking being a preference for short sentences, as if he were afraid
  to adventure upon elaborate English. He had not addressed a dozen
  sentences to Sheila before she had begun to have a liking for the
  lad, perhaps on account of his soft and musical voice, perhaps on
  account of the respectful and almost wondering admiration that dwelt
  in his eyes. He spoke to her as if she were some saint, who had but
  to smile to charm and bewilder the humble worshiper at her
  shrine.</p>

  <p>&quot;I was intending to call upon Mrs. Lavender, madame,&quot; he
  said. &quot;I heard that she was ill. Perhaps you can tell me if she
  is better.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;She seems to be very well to-day, and in very good
  spirits,&quot; Sheila answered.</p>

  <p>&quot;Then I will not go in. Did you propose to take a walk in the
  Park, madame?&quot;</p>

  <p>Lavender inwardly laughed at the magnificent audacity of the lad,
  and, seeing that Sheila hesitated, humored him by saying, &quot;Well,
  we were thinking of calling on one or two people before going home to
  dinner. But I haven&#39;t seen you for a long time, Mosenberg, and I
  want you to tell me how you succeeded at the Conservatoire. If you
  like to walk with us for a bit, we can give you something to eat at
  seven.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That would be very pleasant for me,&quot; said the boy,
  blushing somewhat, &quot;if it does not incommode you,
  madame.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh no: I hope you will come,&quot; said Sheila most
  heartily; and so they set out for a walk through Kensington Gardens
  northward.</p>

  <p>Precious little did Lavender learn about Leipsic during that walk.
  The boy devoted himself wholly to Sheila. He had heard frequently of
  her, and he knew of her coming from the wild and romantic Hebrides;
  and he began to tell her of all the experiments that composers had
  made in representing the sound of seas and storms and winds howling
  through caverns washed by the waves. Lavender liked music well
  enough, and could himself play and sing a little, but this enthusiasm
  rather bored him. He wanted to know if the yellow wine was still as
  cool and clear as ever down in the twilight of Auerbach&#39;s cellar,
  what burlesques had lately been played at the theatre, and whether
  such and such a beer-garden was still to the fore; whereas he heard
  only analyses of overtures, and descriptions of the uses of
  particular musical instruments, and a wild rhapsody about moonlit
  seas, the sweetness of French horns, the King of Thule, and a dozen
  other matters.</p>

  <p>&quot;Mosenberg,&quot; he said, &quot;before you go calling on
  people you ought to visit an English tailor. People will think you
  belong to a German band.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I have been to a tailor,&quot; said the lad with a frank
  laugh. &quot;My parents, madame, wish me to be quite English: that is
  why I am sent to live in London, while they are in Frankfort. I stay
  with some very good friends of mine, who are very musical, and they
  are not annoyed by my practicing, as other people would be.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I hope you will sing something to us this evening,&quot;
  said Sheila.</p>

  <p>&quot;I will sing and play for you all the evening,&quot; he said
  lightly, &quot;until you are tired. But you must tell me when you
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 463]</span> are tired, for who can tell how
  much music will be enough? Sometimes two or three songs are more than
  enough to make people wish you away.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You need have no fear of tiring me,&quot; said Sheila.
  &quot;But when you are tired I will sing for you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, of course you sing, madame,&quot; he said, casting down
  his eyes: &quot;I knew that when I saw you.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila had got a sweetheart, and Lavender saw it and smiled
  good-naturedly. The awe and reverence with which this lad regarded
  the beautiful woman beside him were something new and odd in
  Kensington Gardens. Yet it was the way of those boys. He had himself
  had his imaginative fits of worship, in which some very ordinary
  young woman, who ate a good breakfast and spent an hour and a half in
  arranging her hair before going out, was regarded as some beautiful
  goddess fresh risen from the sea or descended from the clouds. Young
  Mosenberg was just at the proper age for these foolish dreams. He
  would sing songs to Sheila, and reveal to her in that way a passion
  of which he dared not otherwise speak. He would compose pieces of
  music for her, and dedicate them to her, and spend half his quarterly
  allowance in having them printed. He would grow to consider him,
  Lavender, a heartless brute, and cherish dark notions of poisoning
  him, but for the pain it might cause to her.</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t remember whether you smoke, Mosenberg,&quot;
  Lavender said after dinner.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes&#8212;a cigarette sometimes,&quot; said the lad;
  &quot;but if Mrs. Lavender is going away perhaps she will let me go
  into the drawing-room with her. There is that sonata of Muzio
  Clementi, madame, which I will try to remember for you if you
  please.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Lavender: &quot;you&#39;ll find me in
  the next room on the left when you get tired of your music and want a
  cigar. I think you used to beat me at chess, didn&#39;t
  you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I do not know. We will try once more to-night.&quot;</p>

  <p>Then Sheila and he went into the drawing-room by themselves, and
  while she took a seat near the brightly-lit fire-place, he opened the
  piano at once and sat down. He turned up his cuffs, he took a look at
  the pedals, he threw back his head, shaking his long brown hair; and
  then, with a crash like thunder, his two hands struck the keys. He
  had forgotten all about that sonata: it was a fantasia of his own,
  based on the airs in <i>Der Freischütz</i>, that he played; and as he
  played Sheila&#39;s poor little piano suffered somewhat. Never before
  had it been so battered about, and she wished the small chamber were
  a great hall, to temper the voluminous noise of this opening passage.
  But presently the music softened. The white, lithe fingers ran
  lightly over the keys, so that the notes seemed to ripple out like
  the prattling of a stream, and then again some stately and majestic
  air or some joyous burst of song would break upon this light
  accompaniment, and lead up to another roar and rumble of noise. It
  was a very fine performance, doubtless, but what Sheila remarked most
  was the enthusiasm of the lad. She was to see more of that.</p>

  <p>&quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;that is nothing. It is to get
  one&#39;s fingers accustomed to the keys you play anything that is
  loud and rapid. But if you please, madame, shall I sing you
  something?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, do,&quot; said Sheila.</p>

  <p>&quot;I will sing for you a little German song which I believe
  Jenny Lind used to sing, but I never heard her sing. You know
  German?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very little indeed.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;This is only the cry of some one who is far away about his
  sweetheart. It is very simple, both in the words and the
  music.&quot;</p>

  <p>And he began to sing, in a voice so rich, so tender and expressive
  that Sheila sat amazed and bewildered to hear him. Where had this boy
  caught such a trick of passion, or was it really a trick that threw
  into his voice all the pathos of a strong man&#39;s love and grief?
  He had a powerful baritone, of unusual compass and rare sweetness;
  but it was not the finely-trained art of his singing, but the
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 464]</span> passionate abandonment of it,
  that thrilled Sheila, and indeed brought tears to her eyes. How had
  this mere lad learned all the yearning and despair of love, that he
  sang,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i10">Dir bebt die Brust,</p>

      <p class="i10">Dir schlägt dies Herz,</p>

      <p class="i10">Du meine Lust!</p>

      <p class="i10">O du, mein Schmerz!</p>

      <p class="i2">Nur an den Winden, den Sternen der Höh,</p>

      <p class="i2">Muss ich verkünden mein süsses Weh!&#8212;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>as though his heart were breaking? When he had finished he paused
  for a moment or two before leaving the piano, and then he came over
  to where Sheila sat. She fancied there was a strange look on his
  face, as of one who had been really experiencing the wild emotions of
  which he sang; but he said, in his ordinary careful way of speaking,
  &quot;Madame, I am sorry I cannot translate the words for you into
  English. They are too simple; and they have, what is common in many
  German songs, a mingling of the pleasure and the sadness of being in
  love that would not read natural perhaps in English. When he says to
  her that she is his greatest delight and also his greatest grief, it
  is quite right in the German, but not in the English.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But where have you learned all these things?&quot; she said
  to him, talking to him as if he were a mere child, and looking
  without fear into his handsome boyish face and fine eyes. &quot;Sit
  down and tell me. That is the song of some one whose sweetheart is
  far away, you said. But you sang it as if you yourself had some
  sweetheart far away.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;So I have, madame,&quot; he said, seriously: &quot;when I
  sing the song, I think of her then, so that I almost cry for
  her.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And who is she?&quot; said Sheila gently. &quot;Is she very
  far away?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I do not know,&quot; said the lad absently. &quot;I do not
  know who she is. Sometimes I think she is a beautiful woman away at
  St. Petersburg, singing in the opera-house there. Or I think she has
  sailed away in a ship from me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But you do not sing about any particular person?&quot; said
  Sheila, with an innocent wonder appearing in her eyes.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh no, not at all,&quot; said the boy; and then he added,
  with some suddenness, &quot;Do you think, madame, any fine songs like
  that, or any fine words that go to the heart of people, are written
  about any one person? Oh no! The man has a great desire in him to say
  something beautiful or sad, and he says it&#8212;not to one person,
  but to all the world; and all the world takes it from him as a gift.
  Sometimes, yes, he will think of one woman, or he will dedicate the
  music to her, or he will compose it for her wedding, but the feeling
  in his heart is greater than any that he has for her. Can you
  believe, madame, that Mendelssohn wrote the Hochzeitm&#8212;the
  Wedding March&#8212;for any one wedding? No. It was all the marriage
  joy of all the world he put into his music, and every one knows that.
  And you hear it at this wedding, at that wedding, but you know it
  belongs to something far away and more beautiful than the marriage of
  any one bride with her sweetheart. And if you will pardon me, madame,
  for speaking about myself, it is about some one I I never knew, who
  is far more beautiful and precious to me than any one I ever knew,
  that I try to think when I sing these sad songs, and then I think of
  her far away, and not likely ever to see me again.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But some day you will find that you have met her in real
  life,&quot; Sheila said. &quot;And you will find her far more
  beautiful and kind to you than anything you dreamed about; and you
  will try to write your best music to give to her. And then, if you
  should be unhappy, you will find how much worse is the real
  unhappiness about one you love than the sentiment of a song you can
  lay aside at any moment.&quot;</p>

  <p>The lad looked at her. &quot;What can you know about unhappiness,
  madame?&quot; he said with a frank and gentle simplicity that she
  liked.</p>

  <p>&quot;I?&quot; said Sheila. &quot;When people get married and
  begin to experience the cares of the world, they must expect to be
  unhappy sometimes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But not you,&quot; he said with some touch of protest in his
  voice, as if it were impossible the world should deal harshly with so
  young and beautiful and <span class="pagenum">[pg 465]</span> tender
  a creature. &quot;You can have nothing but enjoyment around you.
  Every one must try to please you. You need only condescend to speak
  to people, and they are grateful to you for a great favor. Perhaps,
  madame, you think I am impertinent?&quot;</p>

  <p>He stopped and blushed, while Sheila, herself with a little touch
  of color, answered him that she hoped he would always speak to her
  quite frankly, and then suggested that he might sing once more for
  her.</p>

  <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; he said as he sat down to the piano:
  &quot;this is not any more a sad song. It is about a young lady who
  will not let her sweetheart kiss her, except on conditions. You shall
  hear the conditions, and what he says.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila began to wonder whether this innocent-eyed lad had been
  imposing on her. The song was acted as well as sung. It consisted
  chiefly of a dialogue between the two lovers; and the boy, with a
  wonderful ease and grace and skill, mimicked the shy coquetries of
  the girl, her fits of petulance and dictation, and the pathetic
  remonstrances of her companion, his humble entreaties and his final
  sullenness, which is only conquered by her sudden and ample consent.
  &quot;What a rare faculty of artistic representation this precocious
  boy must have,&quot; she thought, &quot;if he really exhibits all
  those moods and whims and tricks of manner without having himself
  been in the position of the despairing and imploring lover!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You were not thinking of the beautiful lady in St.
  Petersburg when you were singing just now,&quot; Sheila said on his
  coming back to her.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; he said carelessly: &quot;that is nothing. You
  have not to imagine anything. These people, you see them on every
  stage in the comedies and farces.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But that might happen in actual life,&quot; said Sheila,
  still not quite sure about him. &quot;Do you know that many people
  would think you must have yourself been teased in that way, or you
  could not imitate it so naturally?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I! Oh no, madame,&quot; he said seriously: &quot;I should
  not act that way if I were in love with a woman. If I found her a
  comedy-actress, liking to make her amusement out of our relations, I
  should say to her, &#39;Good-evening, mademoiselle: we have both made
  a little mistake.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But you might be so much in love with her that you could not
  leave her without being very miserable.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I might be very much in love with her, yes; but I would
  rather go away and be miserable than be humiliated by such a girl.
  Why do you smile, madame? Do you think I am vain, or that I am too
  young to know anything about that? Perhaps both are true, but one
  cannot help thinking.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Sheila, with a grandly maternal air of
  sympathy and interest, &quot;you must always remember this&#8212;that
  you have something more important to attend to than merely looking
  out for a beautiful sweetheart. That is the fancy of a foolish girl.
  You have your profession, and you must become great and famous in
  that; and then some day, when you meet this beautiful woman and ask
  her to be your wife, she will be bound to do that, and you will
  confer honor on her as well as secure happiness to yourself. Now, if
  you were to fall in love with some coquettish girl like her you were
  singing about, you would have no more ambition to become famous, you
  would lose all interest in everything except her, and she would be
  able to make you miserable by a single word. When you have made a
  name for yourself, and got a good many more years, you will be better
  able to bear anything that happens to you in your love or in your
  marriage.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You are very kind to take so much trouble,&quot; said young
  Mosenberg, looking up with big, grateful eyes. &quot;Perhaps, madame,
  if you are not very busy during the day, you will let me call in
  sometimes, and if there is no one here I will tell you about what I
  am doing, and play for you or sing for you, if you please.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In the afternoons I am always free,&quot; she said.</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you never go out?&quot; he asked.</p><span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 466]</span>

  <p>&quot;Not often. My husband is at his studio most of the
  day.&quot;</p>

  <p>The boy looked at her, hesitated for a moment, and then, with a
  sudden rush of color to his face, &quot;You should not stay so much
  in the house. Will you sometimes go for a little walk with me,
  madame, to Kensington Gardens, if you are not busy in the
  afternoon?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, certainly,&quot; said Sheila, without a moment&#39;s
  embarrassment. &quot;Do you live near them?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No: I live in Sloane street, but the underground railway
  brings me here in a very short time.&quot;</p>

  <p>That mention of Sloane street gave a twinge to Sheila&#39;s heart.
  Ought she to have been so ready to accept offers of new friendship
  just as her old friend had been banished from her?</p>

  <p>&quot;In Sloane street? Do you know Mr. Ingram?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh yes, very well. Do you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He is one of my oldest friends,&quot; said Sheila bravely:
  she would not acknowledge that their intimacy was a thing of the
  past.</p>

  <p>&quot;He is a very good friend to me&#8212;I know that,&quot; said
  young Mosenberg, with a laugh. &quot;He hired a piano merely because
  I used to go into his rooms at night; and now he makes me play over
  all my most difficult music when I go in, and he sits and smokes a
  pipe and pretends to like it. I do not think he does, but I have got
  to do it all the same; and then afterward I sing for him some songs
  that I know he likes. Madame, I think I can surprise you.&quot;</p>

  <p>He went suddenly to the piano and began to sing, in a very quiet
  way,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i2">Oh soft be thy slumbers by Tigh-na-linne&#39;s
    waters:</p>

    <p class="i2">Thy late-wake was sung by MacDiarmid&#39;s fair
    daughters;</p>

    <p class="i2">But far in Lochaber the true heart was weeping</p>

    <p class="i2">Whose hopes are entombed in the grave where
    thou&#39;rt sleeping.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It was the lament of the young girl whose lover had been separated
  from her by false reports, and who died before he could get back to
  Lochaber when the deception was discovered. And the wild, sad air
  that the girl is supposed to sing seemed so strange with those new
  chords that this boy-musician gave it that Sheila sat and listened to
  it as though it were the sound of the seas about Borva coming to her
  with a new voice and finding her altered and a stranger.</p>

  <p>&quot;I know nearly all of those Highland songs that Mr. Ingram
  has got,&quot; said the lad.</p>

  <p>&quot;I did not know he had any,&quot; Sheila said.</p>

  <p>&quot;Sometimes he tries to sing one himself,&quot; said the boy
  with a smile, &quot;but he does not sing very well, and he gets vexed
  with himself in fun, and flings things about the room. But you will
  sing some of those songs, madame, and let me hear how they are sung
  in the North?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Some time,&quot; said Sheila. &quot;I would rather listen
  just now to all you can tell me about Mr. Ingram&#8212;he is such a
  very old friend of mine, and I do not know how he lives.&quot;</p>

  <p>The lad speedily discovered that there was at least one way of
  keeping his new and beautiful friend profoundly interested; and
  indeed he went on talking until Lavender came into the room in
  evening dress. It was eleven o&#39;clock, and young Mosenberg started
  up with a thousand apologies and hopes that he had not detained Mrs.
  Lavender. No, Mrs. Lavender was not going out: her husband was going
  round for an hour to a ball that Mrs. Kavanagh was giving, but she
  preferred to stay at home.</p>

  <p>&quot;May I call upon you to-morrow afternoon, madame?&quot; said
  the boy as he was leaving.</p>

  <p>&quot;I shall be very glad if you will,&quot; Sheila answered.</p>

  <p>And as he went along the pavement young Mosenberg observed to his
  companion that Mrs. Lavender did not seem to have gone out much, and
  that it was very good of her to have promised to go with him
  occasionally into Kensington Gardens.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, has she?&quot; said Lavender.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the lad with some surprise.</p>

  <p>&quot;You are lucky to be able to get her to leave the
  house,&quot; her husband said: &quot;I
  can&#39;t.&quot;</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 467]</span>

  <p>Perhaps he had not tried so much as the words seemed to
  imply.</p><a name="thulechxvii" id="thulechxvii">

  <h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

  <h3>GUESSES.</h3>

  <p>&quot;Mr. Ingram,&quot; cried young Mosenberg, bursting into the
  room of his friend, &quot;do you know that I have seen your princess
  from the island of the Atlantic? Yes, I met her yesterday, and I went
  up to the house, and I dined there and spent all the evening
  there.&quot;</p>

  <p>Ingram was not surprised, nor, apparently, much interested. He was
  cutting open the leaves of a quarterly review, and a freshly-filled
  pipe lay on the table beside him. A fire had been lit, for the
  evenings were getting chill occasionally; the shutters were shut;
  there was some whisky on the table; so that this small apartment
  seemed to have its share of bachelors&#39; comforts.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Ingram quietly, &quot;did you play for
  her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And sing for her too?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Did you play and sing your very best for her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, I did. But I have not told you half yet. This afternoon
  I went up, and she went out for a walk with me; and we went down
  through Kensington Gardens, and all round by the
  Serpentine&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Did she go into that parade of people?&quot; said Ingram,
  looking up with some surprise.</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the lad, looking rather crestfallen, for he
  would have liked to show off Sheila to some of his friends, &quot;she
  would not go: she preferred to watch the small boats on the
  Serpentine; and she was very kind, too, in speaking to the children,
  and helping them with their boats, although some people stared at
  her. And what is more than all these things, to-morrow night she
  comes with me to a concert in the St. James&#39;s
  Hall&#8212;yes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You are very fortunate,&quot; said Ingram with a smile, for
  he was well pleased to hear that Sheila had taken a fancy to the boy,
  and was likely to find his society amusing. &quot;But you have not
  told me yet what you think of her.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What I think of her?&quot; said the lad, pausing in a
  bewildered way, as if he could find no words to express his opinion
  of Sheila. And then he said, suddenly, &quot;I think she is like the
  Mother of God.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You irreverent young rascal!&quot; said Ingram, lighting his
  pipe, &quot;how dare you say such a thing?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I mean in the pictures&#8212;in the tall pictures you see in
  some churches abroad, far up in a half-darkness. She has the same
  sweet, compassionate look, and her eyes are sometimes a little sad;
  and when she speaks to you, you think you have known her for a long
  time, and that she wishes to be very kind to you. But she is not a
  princess at all, as you told me. I expected to find her grand,
  haughty, willful&#8212;yes; but she is much too friendly for that;
  and when she laughs you see she could not sweep about a room and
  stare at people. But if she was angry or proud, perhaps
  then&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;See you don&#39;t make her angry, then,&quot; said Ingram.
  &quot;Now go and play over all you were practicing in the morning.
  No! stop a bit. Sit down and tell me something more about your
  experiences of Shei&#8212;of Mrs. Lavender.&quot;</p>

  <p>Young Mosenberg laughed and sat down: &quot;Do you know, Mr.
  Ingram, that the same thing occurred the night before last? I was
  about to sing some more, or I was asking Mrs. Lavender to sing some
  more&#8212;I forget which&#8212;but she said to me, &#39;Not just
  now. I wish you to sit down and tell me all you know about Mr.
  Ingram.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And she no sooner honors you with her confidence than you
  carry it to every one?&quot; said Ingram, somewhat fearful of the
  boy&#39;s tongue.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, as to that,&quot; said the lad, delighted to see that
  his friend was a little embarrassed&#8212;&quot;As to that, I believe
  she is in love with you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Mosenberg,&quot; said Ingram with a flash of anger in the
  dark eyes, &quot;if you were half a dozen years older I would
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 468]</span> thrash the life out of you. Do
  you think that is a pretty sort of joke to make about a woman?
  Don&#39;t you know the mischief your gabbling tongue might make? for
  how is every one to know that you are talking merely impertinent
  nonsense?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said the boy audaciously, &quot;I did not mean
  anything of the kind you see in comedies or in operas, breaking up
  marriages and causing duels? Oh no. I think she is in love with you
  as I am in love with her; and I am, ever since yesterday.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, I will say this for you,&quot; remarked Ingram slowly,
  &quot;that you are the cheekiest young beggar I have the pleasure to
  know. You are in love with her, are you? A lady admits you to her
  house, is particularly kind to you, talks to you in confidence, and
  then you go and tell people that you are in love with her!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I did not tell people,&quot; said Mosenberg, flushing under
  the severity of the reproof: &quot;I told you only, and I thought you
  would understand what I meant. I should have told Lavender himself
  just as soon&#8212;yes; only he would not care.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Bah!&quot; said the boy impatiently. &quot;Cannot one see
  it? You have a pretty wife&#8212;much prettier than any one you would
  see at a ball at Mrs. Kavanagh&#39;s&#8212;and you leave her at home,
  and you go to the ball to amuse yourself.&quot;</p>

  <p>This boy, Ingram perceived, was getting to see too clearly how
  matters stood. He bade him go and play some music, having first
  admonished him gravely about the necessity of keeping some watch and
  ward over his tongue. Then the pipe was re-lit, and a fury of sound
  arose at the other end of the room.</p>

  <p>So Lavender, forgetful of the true-hearted girl who loved him,
  forgetful of his own generous instincts, forgetful of the future that
  his fine abilities promised, was still dangling after this alien
  woman, and Sheila was left at home, with her troubles and piteous
  yearnings and fancies as her only companions? Once upon a time Ingram
  could have gone straight up to him and admonished him, and driven him
  to amend his ways. But now that was impossible.</p>

  <p>What was still possible? One wild project occurred to him for a
  moment, but he laughed at it and dismissed it. It was that he should
  go boldly to Mrs. Lorraine herself, ask her plainly if she knew what
  cruel injury she was doing to this young wife, and force her to turn
  Lavender adrift. But what enterprise of the days of old romance could
  be compared with this mad proposal? To ride up to a castle, blow a
  trumpet, and announce that unless a certain lady were released
  forthwith death and destruction would begin,&#8212;all that was
  simple enough, easy and according to rule; but to go into a
  lady&#39;s drawing-room without an introduction, and request her to
  stop a certain flirtation,&#8212;that was a much more awful
  undertaking. But Ingram could not altogether dismiss this notion from
  his head. Mosenberg went on playing&#8212;no longer his
  practicing-pieces, but all manner of airs which he knew Ingram
  liked&#8212;while the small sallow man with the brown beard lay in
  his easy-chair and smoked his pipe, and gazed attentively at his toes
  on the fender.</p>

  <p>&quot;You know Mrs. Kavanagh and her daughter, don&#39;t you,
  Mosenberg?&quot; he said during an interval in the music.</p>

  <p>&quot;Not much,&quot; said the boy. &quot;They were in England
  only a little while before I went to Leipsic.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I should like to know them.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That is very easy. Mr. Lavender will introduce you to them:
  Mrs. Lavender said he went there very much.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What would they do, do you think, if I went up and asked to
  see them?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The servant would ask if it was about beer or coals that you
  called.&quot;</p>

  <p>A man will do much for a woman who is his friend, but to be
  suspected of being a brewer&#39;s traveler, to have to push one&#39;s
  way into a strange drawing-room, to have to confront the awful stare
  of the inmates, and then to have to deliver a message which they will
  probably consider as the very extreme of audacious and meddling
  impertinence! The prospect was not pleasant, and yet Ingram,
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 469]</span> as he sat and thought over it
  that evening, finally resolved to encounter all these dangers and
  wounds. He could help Sheila in no other way. He was banished from
  her house. Perhaps he might induce this American girl to release her
  captive and give Lavender back to his own wife. What were a few
  twinges of one&#39;s self-respect, or risks of a humiliating failure,
  compared with the possibility of befriending Sheila in some small
  way?</p>

  <p>Next morning he went early in to Whitehall, and about one
  o&#39;clock in the forenoon started off for Holland Park. He wore a
  tall hat, a black frock-coat and yellow kid gloves. He went in a
  hansom, so that the person who opened the door should know that he
  was not a brewer&#39;s traveler. In this wise he reached Mrs.
  Kavanagh&#39;s house, which Lavender had frequently pointed out to
  him in passing, about half-past one, and with some internal tremors,
  but much outward calmness, went up the broad stone steps.</p>

  <p>A small boy in buttons opened the door.</p>

  <p>&quot;Is Mrs. Lorraine at home?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the boy.</p>

  <p>It was the simplest thing in the world. In a couple of seconds he
  found himself in a big drawing-room, and the youth had taken his card
  up stairs. Ingram was not very sure whether his success, so far, was
  due to the hansom, or to his tall hat, or to a silver-headed cane
  which his grandfather had brought home from India. However, here he
  was in the house, just like the hero of one of those fine old farces
  of our youth, who jumps from the street into a strange drawing-room,
  flirts with the maid, hides behind a screen, confronts the master,
  and marries his daughter, all in half an hour, the most exacting
  unities of time and place being faithfully observed.</p>

  <p>Presently the door was opened, and a young lady, pale and calm and
  sweet of face, approached him, and not only bowed to him, but held
  out her hand.</p>

  <p>&quot;I have much pleasure in making your acquaintance, Mr.
  Ingram,&quot; she said, gently and somewhat slowly. &quot;Mr.
  Lavender has frequently promised to bring you to see us, for he has
  spoken to us so much about you that we had begun to think we already
  knew you. Will you come with me up stairs, that I may introduce you
  to mamma?&quot;</p>

  <p>Ingram had come prepared to state harsh truths bluntly, and was
  ready to meet any sort of anger or opposition with a perfect
  frankness of intention. But he certainly had not come prepared to
  find the smart-tongued and fascinating American widow, of whom he had
  heard so much, a quiet, self-possessed and gracious young lady, of
  singularly winning manners and clear and resolutely honest eyes. Had
  Lavender been quite accurate, or even conscientious, in his garrulous
  talk about Mrs. Lorraine?</p>

  <p>&quot;If you will excuse me,&quot; said Ingram, with a smile that
  had less of embarrassment about it than he could have expected,
  &quot;I would rather speak to you for a few minutes first. The fact
  is, I have come on a self-imposed errand; and that must be my apology
  for&#8212;for thrusting myself&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am sure no apology is needed,&quot; said the girl.
  &quot;We have always been expecting to see you. Will you sit
  down?&quot;</p>

  <p>He put his hat and his cane on the table, and as he did so he
  recorded a mental resolution not to be led away by the apparent
  innocence and sweetness of this woman. What a fool he had been, to
  expect her to appear in the guise of some forward and giggling
  coquette, as if Frank Lavender, with all his faults, could have
  suffered anything like coarseness of manners! But was this woman any
  the less dangerous that she was refined and courteous, and had the
  speech and bearing of a gentlewoman?</p>

  <p>&quot;Mrs. Lorraine,&quot; he said, lowering his eyebrows
  somewhat, &quot;I may as well be frank with you. I have come upon an
  unpleasant errand&#8212;an affair, indeed, which ought to be no
  business of mine; but sometimes, when you care a little for some one,
  you don&#39;t mind running the risk of being treated as an
  intermeddler. You know that I know Mrs. Lavender. She is an old
  friend of mine. She was <span class="pagenum">[pg 470]</span> almost
  a child when I knew her first, and I still have a sort of notion that
  she is a child, and that I should look after her, and so&#8212;and
  so&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>She sat quite still. There was no surprise, no alarm, no anger
  when Sheila&#39;s name was mentioned. She was merely attentive, but
  now, seeing that he hesitated, she said, &quot;I do not know what you
  have to say, but if it is serious may not I ask mamma to join
  us?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If you please, no. I would rather speak with you alone, as
  this matter concerns yourself only. Well, the fact is, I have seen
  for some time back that Mrs. Lavender is very unhappy. She is left
  alone; she knows no one in London; perhaps she does not care to join
  much in those social amusements that her husband enjoys. I say this
  poor girl is an old friend of mine: I cannot help trying to do
  something to make her less wretched; and so I have ventured to come
  to you to see if you could not assist me. Mr. Lavender comes very
  much to your house, and Sheila is left all by herself; and doubtless
  she begins to fancy that her husband is neglectful, perhaps
  indifferent to her, and may get to imagine things that are quite
  wrong, you know, and that could be explained away by a little
  kindness on your part.&quot;</p>

  <p>Was this, then, the fashion in which Jonah had gone up to curse
  the wickedness of Nineveh? As he had spoken he had been aware that
  those sincere, somewhat matter&#8212;of-fact and far from unfriendly
  eyes that were fixed on him had undergone no change whatever. Here
  was no vile creature who would start up with a guilty conscience to
  repel the remotest hint of an accusation; and indeed, quite
  unconsciously to himself, he had been led on to ask for her help. Not
  that he feared her. Not that he could not have said the harshest
  things to her which there was any reason for saying. But somehow
  there seemed to be no occasion for the utterance of any cruel
  truths.</p>

  <p>The wonder of it was, too, that instead of being wounded,
  indignant and angry, as he had expected her to be, she betrayed a
  very friendly interest in Sheila, as though she herself had nothing
  whatever to do with the matter.</p>

  <p>&quot;You have undertaken a very difficult task, Mr. Ingram,&quot;
  she said with a smile. &quot;I don&#39;t think there are many married
  ladies in London who have a friend who would do as much for them.
  And, to tell you the truth, both my mamma and myself have come to the
  same conclusion as yourself about Mr. Lavender. It is really too bad,
  the way in which he allows that pretty young thing to remain at home,
  for I suppose she would go more into society if he were to coax her
  and persuade her. We have done what we could in sending her
  invitations, in calling on her, and in begging Mr. Lavender to bring
  her with him. But he has always some excuse for her, so that we never
  see her. And yet I am sure he does not mean to give her pain; for he
  is very proud of her, and madly extravagant wherever she is
  concerned; and sometimes he takes sudden fits of trying to please her
  and be kind to her that are quite odd in their way. Can you tell me
  what we should do?&quot;</p>

  <p>Ingram looked at her for a moment, and said gravely and slowly,
  &quot;Before we talk any more about that I must clear my conscience.
  I perceive that I have done you a wrong. I came here prepared to
  accuse you of drawing away Mr. Lavender from his wife, of seeking
  amusement, and perhaps some social distinction, by keeping him
  continually dangling after you; and I meant to reproach you, or even
  threaten you, until you promised never to see him again.&quot;</p>

  <p>A quick flush, partly of shame and partly of annoyance, sprang to
  Mrs. Lorraine&#39;s fair and pale face; but she answered calmly,
  &quot;It is perhaps as well that you did not tell me this a few
  minutes ago. May I ask what has led you to change your opinion of me,
  if it has changed?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Of course it has changed,&quot; he said, promptly and
  emphatically. &quot;I can see that I did you a great injury, and I
  apologize for it, and beg your forgiveness. But when you ask me what
  has led me to change my opinion, what am I to say? Your manner,
  perhaps, more than what <span class="pagenum">[pg 471]</span> you
  have said has convinced me that I was wrong.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Perhaps you are again mistaken,&quot; she said coldly:
  &quot;you get rapidly to conclusions.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The reproof is just,&quot; he said. &quot;You are quite
  right. I have made a blunder: there is no mistake about it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But do you think it was fair,&quot; she said with some
  spirit&#8212;&quot;do you think it was fair to believe all this harm
  about a woman you had never seen? Now, listen. A hundred times I have
  begged Mr. Lavender to be more attentive to his wife&#8212;not in
  these words, of course, but as directly as I could. Mamma has given
  parties, made arrangements for visits, drives and all sorts of
  things, to tempt Mrs. Lavender to come to us, and all in vain. Of
  course you can&#39;t thrust yourself on any one like that. Though
  mamma and myself like Mrs. Lavender very well, it is asking too much
  that we should encounter the humiliation of intermeddling.&quot;</p>

  <p>Here she stopped suddenly, with the least show of embarrassment.
  Then she said frankly, &quot;You are an old friend of hers. It is
  very good of you to have risked so much for the sake of that girl.
  There are very few gentlemen whom one meets who would do as
  much.&quot;</p>

  <p>Ingram could say nothing, and was a little impatient with himself.
  Was he to be first reproved, and then treated with an indulgent
  kindness, by a mere girl?</p>

  <p>&quot;Mamma,&quot; said Mrs. Lorraine, as an elderly lady entered
  the room, &quot;let me introduce to you Mr. Ingram, whom you must
  already know. He proposes we should join in some conspiracy to
  inveigle Mrs. Lavender into society, and make the poor little thing
  amuse herself.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Little!&quot; said Mrs. Kavanagh with a smile: &quot;she is
  a good deal taller than you are, my dear. But I am afraid, Mr.
  Ingram, you have undertaken a hopeless task. Will you stay to
  luncheon and talk it over with us?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I hope you will,&quot; said Mrs. Lorraine; and naturally
  enough he consented.</p>

  <p>Luncheon was just ready. As they were going into the room on the
  opposite side of the hall, the younger lady said to Ingram in a quiet
  undertone, but with much indifference of manner, &quot;You know, if
  you think I ought to give up Mr. Lavender&#39;s acquaintance
  altogether, I will do so at once. But perhaps that will not be
  necessary.&quot;</p>

  <p>So this was the house in which Sheila&#39;s husband spent so much
  of his time, and these were the two ladies of whom so much had been
  said and surmised? There were three of Lavender&#39;s pictures on the
  walls of the dining-room, and as Ingram inadvertently glanced at
  them, Mrs. Lorraine said to him, &quot;Don&#39;t you think it is a
  pity Mr. Lavender should continue drawing those imaginative sketches
  of heads? I do not think, myself, that he does himself justice in
  that way. Some bits of landscape, now, that I have seen seemed to me
  to have quite a definite character about them, and promised far more
  than anything else of his I have seen.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That is precisely what I think,&quot; said Ingram, partly
  amused and partly annoyed to find that this girl, with her clear gray
  eyes, her soft and musical voice and her singular delicacy of manner,
  had an evil trick of saying the very things he would himself have
  said, and leaving him with nothing but a helpless
  &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I think he ought to have given up his club when he married.
  Most English gentlemen do that when they marry, do they not?&quot;
  said Mrs. Kavanagh.</p>

  <p>&quot;Some,&quot; said Ingram. &quot;But a good deal of nonsense
  is talked about the influence of clubs in that way. It is really
  absurd to suppose that the size or the shape of a building can alter
  a man&#39;s moral character.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It does, though,&quot; said Mrs. Lorraine confidently.
  &quot;I can tell directly if a gentleman has been accustomed to spend
  his time in clubs. When he is surprised or angry or impatient you can
  perceive blanks in his conversation which in a club, I suppose, would
  be filled up. Don&#39;t you know poor old Colonel Hannen&#39;s way of
  talking, mamma? This old gentleman, Mr. Ingram, is very fond of
  speaking to you about political liberty <span class="pagenum">[pg
  472]</span> and the rights of conscience; and he generally becomes so
  confused that he gets vexed with himself, and makes odd pauses, as if
  he were invariably addressing himself in very rude language indeed.
  Sometimes you would think he was like a railway-engine, going blindly
  and helplessly on through a thick and choking mist; and you can see
  that if there were no ladies present he would let off a few
  crackers&#8212;fog-signals, as it were&#8212;just to bring himself up
  a bit, and let people know where he was. Then he will go on again,
  talking away until you fancy yourself in a tunnel, with a throbbing
  noise in your ears and all the daylight shut out, and you perhaps
  getting to wish that on the whole you were dead.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Cecilia!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I beg your pardon, mamma,&quot; said the younger lady with a
  quiet smile &quot;you look so surprised that Mr. Ingram will give me
  credit for not often erring in that way. You look as though a hare
  had turned and attacked you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That would give most people a fright,&quot; said Ingram with
  a laugh. He was rapidly forgetting the object of his mission. The
  almost childish softness of voice of this girl, and the perfect
  composure with which she uttered little sayings that showed
  considerable sharpness of observation and a keen enjoyment of the
  grotesque, had an odd sort of fascination for him. He totally forgot
  that Lavender had been fascinated by it too. If he had been reminded
  of the fact at this moment he would have said that the <i>boy</i>
  had, as usual, got sentimental about a pretty pair of big gray eyes
  and a fine profile, while he, Ingram, was possessed by nothing but a
  purely intellectual admiration of certain fine qualities of wit,
  sincerity of speech and womanly shrewdness.</p>

  <p>Luncheon, indeed, was over before any mention was made of the
  Lavenders; and when they returned to that subject it appeared to
  Ingram that their relations had in the mean time got to be very
  friendly, and that they were really discussing this matter as if they
  formed a little family conclave.</p>

  <p>&quot;I have told Mr. Ingram, mamma,&quot; Mrs. Lorraine said,
  &quot;that so far as I am concerned I will do whatever he thinks I
  ought to do. Mr. Lavender has been a friend of ours for some time,
  and of course he cannot be treated with rudeness or incivility; but
  if we are wounding the feelings of any one by asking him to come
  here&#8212;and he certainly visited us pretty often&#8212;why, it
  would be easy to lessen the number of his calls. Is that what we
  should do, Mr. Ingram? You would not have us quarrel with
  him?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Especially,&quot; said Mrs. Kavanagh with a smile,
  &quot;that there is no certainty he will spend more of his time with
  his wife merely because he spends less of it here. And yet I fancy he
  is a very good-natured man.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He <i>is</i> very good-natured,&quot; said Ingram with
  decision. &quot;I have known him for years, and I know that he is
  exceedingly unselfish, and that he would do a ridiculously generous
  thing to serve a friend, and that a better-intentioned fellow does
  not breathe in the world. But he is at times, I admit, very
  thoughtless and inconsiderate.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That sort of good-nature,&quot; said Mrs. Lorraine in her
  gentlest voice, &quot;is very good in its way, but rather uncertain.
  So long as it shines in one direction, it is all right and quite
  trustworthy, for you want a hard brush to brush sunlight off a wall.
  But when the sunlight shifts, you know&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The wall is left in the cold. Well,&quot; said Ingram,
  &quot;I am afraid it is impossible for me to dictate to you what you
  ought to do. I do not wish to draw you into any interference between
  husband and wife, or even to let Mr. Lavender know that you think he
  is not treating Shei&#8212;Mrs. Lavender&#8212;properly. But if you
  were to hint to him that he ought to pay some attention to
  her&#8212;that he should not be going everywhere as if he were a
  young bachelor in chambers; if you would discourage his coming to see
  you without bringing her also, and so forth&#8212;surely he would see
  what you mean. Perhaps I ask too much of you, but I had intended to
  ask more. The fact is, <span class="pagenum">[pg 473]</span> Mrs.
  Kavanagh, I had done your daughter the injustice of
  supposing&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I thought we had agreed to say no more about that,&quot;
  said Mrs. Lorraine quickly, and Ingram was silent.</p>

  <p>Half an hour thereafter he was walking back through Holland Park,
  through the warm light of an autumn afternoon. The place seemed much
  changed since he had seen it a couple of hours before. The double
  curve of big houses had a more friendly and hospitable look: the very
  air seemed to be more genial and comfortable since he had driven up
  here in the hansom.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Mr. Ingram was at this moment a little more perturbed,
  pleased and bewildered than he would have liked to confess. He had
  discovered a great deal in these two hours, been much surprised and
  fascinated, and had come away fairly stupefied with the result of his
  mission. He had indeed been successful: Lavender would now find a
  different welcome awaiting him in the house in which he had been
  spending nearly all his time, to the neglect of his wife. But the
  fact is, that as Edward Ingram went rapidly over in his own mind
  everything that had occurred since his entrance into that house, as
  he anxiously recalled the remarks made to him, the tone and looks
  accompanying them, and his own replies, it was not of Lavender&#39;s
  affairs alone that he thought. He confessed to himself frankly that
  he had never yet met any woman who had so surprised him into
  admiration on their first meeting.</p>

  <p>Yet what had she said? Nothing very particular. Was it the bright
  intelligence of the gray eyes, that seemed to see everything he meant
  with an instant quickness, and that seemed to agree with him even
  before he spoke? He reflected, now that he was in the open air, that
  he must have persecuted these two women dreadfully. In getting away
  from Lavender&#39;s affairs they had touched on pictures, books and
  what not&#8212;on the young poet who was playing Alfred de Musset in
  England; on the great philosopher who had gone into the House to
  confuse and bewilder the country gentlemen there; on all sorts of
  topics, indeed, except those which, as Ingram had anticipated, such a
  creature as Mrs. Lorraine would naturally have found interesting. And
  he had to confess to himself that he had lectured his two helpless
  victims most unmercifully. He was quite conscious that he sometimes
  laid down the law in an authoritative and even sententious manner. On
  first going into the house certain things said by Mrs. Lorraine had
  almost surprised him into a mood of mere acquiescence; but after
  luncheon he had assumed his ordinary manner of tutor in general to
  the universe, and had informed those two women, in a distinct
  fashion, what their opinions ought to be on half the social
  conundrums of the day.</p>

  <p>He now reflected, with much compunction, that this was highly
  improper. He ought to have asked about flower-shows, and inquired
  whether the princess of Wales was looking well of late. Some
  reference to the last Parisian comedy might have introduced a
  disquisition on the new grays and greens of the French milliners,
  with a passing mention made of the price paid for a pair of ponies by
  a certain marquise unattached. He had not spoken of one of these
  things: perhaps he could not if he had tried. He remembered, with an
  awful consciousness of guilt, that he had actually discoursed of
  woman suffrage, of the public conscience of New York, of the
  extirpation of the Indians, and a dozen different things, not only
  taking no heed of any opinions that his audience of two might hold,
  but insisting on their accepting his opinions as the expression of
  absolute and incontrovertible truth.</p>

  <p>He became more and more dissatisfied with himself. If he could
  only go back now, he would be much more wary, more submissive and
  complaisant, more anxious to please. What right had he to abuse the
  courtesy and hospitality of these two strangers, and lecture them on
  the Constitution of their own country? He was annoyed beyond
  expression that they had listened to him with so much patience.</p>

  <p>And yet he could not have seriously offended them, for they had
  earnestly <span class="pagenum">[pg 474]</span> besought him to dine
  with them on the following Tuesday evening, to meet an American
  judge; and when he had consented Mrs. Lorraine had written down on a
  card the date and hour, lest he should forget. He had that card in
  his pocket: surely he could not have offended them? If he had pursued
  this series of questions, he might have gone on to ask himself why he
  should be so anxious not to have offended these two new friends. He
  was not ordinarily very sensitive to the opinions that might be
  formed of him&#8212;more especially by persons living out of his own
  sphere, with whom he was not likely to associate. He did not, indeed,
  as a general rule, suffer himself to be perturbed about anything; and
  yet, as he went along the busy thoroughfare at this moment, he was
  conscious that rarely in his life had he been so ill at ease.</p>

  <p>Something now occurred that startled him out of his reverie.
  Communing with himself, he was staring blankly ahead, taking little
  note of the people whom he saw. But somehow, in a vague and dreamlike
  way, he seemed to become aware that there was some one in front of
  him&#8212;a long way ahead as yet&#8212;whom he knew. He was still
  thinking of Mrs. Lorraine, and unconsciously postponing the
  examination of this approaching figure, or rather pair of figures,
  when, with a sudden start, he found Sheila&#39;s sad and earnest eyes
  fixed upon him. He woke up as from a dream. He saw that young
  Mosenberg was with her, and naturally the boy would have approached
  Ingram, and stopped and spoken. But Ingram paid no attention to him.
  He was, with a quick pang at his heart, regarding Sheila, with the
  knowledge that on her rested the cruel decision as to whether she
  should come forward to him or not. He was not aware that her husband
  had forbidden her to have any communication with him; yet he had
  guessed as much, partly from his knowledge of Lavender&#39;s
  impatient disposition, and partly from the glance he caught of her
  eyes when he woke up from his trance.</p>

  <p>Young Mosenberg turned with surprise to his companion. She was
  passing on: he did not even see that she had bowed to Ingram, with a
  face flushed with shame and pain and with eyes cast down. Ingram,
  too, was passing on, without even shaking hands with her or uttering
  a word. Mosenberg was too bewildered to attempt any protest: he
  merely followed Sheila, with a conviction that something desperate
  had occurred, and that he would best consult her feelings by making
  no reference to it.</p>

  <p>But that one look that the girl had directed to her old friend
  before she bowed and passed on had filled him with dismay and
  despair. It was somehow like the piteous look of a wounded animal,
  incapable of expressing its pain. All thoughts and fancies of his own
  little vexations or embarrassments were instantly banished from him:
  he could only see before him those sad and piteous eyes, full of
  kindness to him, he thought, and of grief that she should be debarred
  from speaking to him, and of resignation to her own lot.</p>

  <p>Gwdyr House did not get much work out of him that day. He sat in a
  small room in a back part of the building, looking out on a lonely
  little square, silent and ruddy with the reflected light of the
  sunset.</p>

  <p>&quot;A hundred Mrs. Kavanaghs,&quot; he was thinking to himself
  bitterly enough, &quot;will not save my poor Sheila. She will die of
  a broken heart. I can see it in her face. And it is I who have done
  it&#8212;from first to last it is I who have done it; and now I can
  do nothing to help her.&quot;</p>

  <p>That became the burden and refrain of all his reflections. It was
  he who had done this frightful thing. It was he who had taken away
  the young Highland girl, his good Sheila, from her home, and ruined
  her life and broken her heart. And he could do nothing to help
  her!</p><a name="thulechxviii" id="thulechxviii">

  <h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

  <h3>SHEILA&#39;S STRATAGEM.</h3>

  <p>&quot;We met Mr. Ingram to-day,&quot; said young Mosenberg
  ingenuously.</p>

  <p>He was dining with Lavender, not at <span class="pagenum">[pg
  475]</span> home, but at a club in St. James&#39;s street; and either
  his curiosity was too great, or he had forgotten altogether
  Ingram&#39;s warnings to him that he should hold his tongue.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, did you?&quot; said Lavender, showing no great interest.
  &quot;Waiter, some French mustard. What did Ingram say to
  you?&quot;</p>

  <p>The question was asked with much apparent indifference, and the
  boy stared. &quot;Well,&quot; he said at length, &quot;I suppose
  there is some misunderstanding between Mrs. Lavender and Mr. Ingram,
  for they both saw each other, and they both passed on without
  speaking: I was very sorry&#8212;yes. I thought they were
  friends&#8212;I thought Mr. Ingram knew Mrs. Lavender even before you
  did; but they did not speak to each other, not one word.&quot;</p>

  <p>Lavender was in one sense pleased to hear this. He liked to hear
  that his wife was obedient to him. But, he said to himself with a
  sharp twinge of conscience, she was carrying her obedience too far.
  He had never meant that she should not even speak to her old friend.
  He would show Sheila that he was not unreasonable. He would talk to
  her about it as soon as he got home, and in as kindly a way as was
  possible.</p>

  <p>Mosenberg did not play billiards, but they remained late in the
  billiard-room, Lavender playing pool, and getting out of it rather
  successfully. He could not speak to Sheila that night, but next
  morning, before going out, he did.</p>

  <p>&quot;Sheila,&quot; he said, &quot;Mosenberg told me last night
  that you met Mr. Ingram and did not speak to him. Now, I didn&#39;t
  mean anything like that. You must not think me unreasonable. All I
  want is, that he shall not interfere with our affairs and try to
  raise some unpleasantness between you and me, such as might arise
  from the interference of even the kindest of friends. When you meet
  him outside or at any one&#39;s house, I hope you will speak to him
  just as usual.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila replied calmly, &quot;If I am not allowed to receive Mr.
  Ingram here, I cannot treat him as a friend elsewhere. I would rather
  not have friends whom I can only speak to in the streets.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Lavender, wincing under the rebuke,
  but fancying that she would soon repent her of this resolve. In the
  mean time, if she would have it so, she should have it so.</p>

  <p>So that was an end of this question of Mr. Ingram&#39;s
  interference for the present. But very soon&#8212;in a couple of
  days, indeed&#8212;Lavender perceived the change that had been
  wrought in the house in Holland Park to which he had been accustomed
  to resort.</p>

  <p>&quot;Cecilia,&quot; Mrs. Kavanagh had said on Ingram&#39;s
  leaving, &quot;you must not be rude to Mr. Lavender.&quot; She knew
  the perfect independence of that gentle young lady, and was rather
  afraid it might carry her too far.</p>

  <p>&quot;Of course I shall not be, mamma,&quot; Mrs. Lorraine had
  said. &quot;Did you ever hear of such a courageous act as that man
  coming up to two strangers and challenging them, all on behalf of a
  girl married to some one else? You know that was the meaning of his
  visit. He thought I was flirting with Mr. Lavender and keeping him
  from his wife. I wonder how many men there are in London who would
  have walked twenty yards to help in such a matter?&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear, he may have been in love with that pretty young
  lady before she was married.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; said the clear-eyed daughter quietly, but quite
  confidently. &quot;He would not be so ready to show his interest in
  her if that were so. Either he would be modest, and ashamed of his
  rejection, or vain, and attempt to make a mystery about it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Perhaps you are right,&quot; said the mother: she seldom
  found her daughter wrong on such points.</p>

  <p>&quot;I am sure I am right, mamma. He talks about her as fondly
  and frequently and openly as a man might talk about his own daughter.
  Besides, you can see that he is talking honestly. The man
  couldn&#39;t deceive a child if he were to try. You see everything in
  his face.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You seem to have been much <span class="pagenum">[pg
  476]</span> interested in him,&quot; said Mrs. Kavanagh, with no
  appearance of sarcasm.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, I don&#39;t think I meet such men often, and that is
  the truth. Do you?&quot; This was carrying the war into the
  enemy&#39;s country.</p>

  <p>&quot;I like him very well,&quot; said Mrs. Kavanagh. &quot;I
  think he is honest. I do not think he dresses very carefully; and he
  is perhaps too intent on convincing you that his opinions are
  right.&quot; &quot;Well, for my part,&quot; said her daughter, with
  just the least tinge of warmth in her manner, &quot;I confess I like
  a man who has opinions, and who is not afraid to say so. I don&#39;t
  find many who have. And for his dressing, one gets rather tired of
  men who come to you every evening to impress you with the excellence
  of their tailor. As if women were to be captured by millinery!
  Don&#39;t we know the value of linen and woolen fabrics?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear child, you are throwing away your vexation on some
  one whom I don&#39;t know. It isn&#39;t Mr. Lavender?&quot; &quot;Oh
  dear, no! He is not so silly as that: he dresses well, but there is
  perfect freedom about his dress. He is too much of an artist to
  sacrifice himself to his clothes.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am glad you have a good word for him at last. I think you
  have been rather hard on him since Mr. Ingram called; and that is the
  reason I asked you to be careful.&quot;</p>

  <p>She was quite careful, but as explicit as good manners would
  allow. Mrs. Lorraine was most particular in asking about Mrs.
  Lavender, and in expressing her regret that they so seldom saw
  her.</p>

  <p>&quot;She has been brought up in the country, you know,&quot; said
  Lavender with a smile; &quot;and there the daughters of a house are
  taught a number of domestic duties that they would consider it a sin
  to neglect. She would be unhappy if you caused her to neglect them:
  she would take her pleasure with a bad conscience.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But she cannot be occupied with them all day.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear Mrs. Lorraine, how often have we discussed the
  question! And you know you have me at a disadvantage, for how can I
  describe to you what those mysterious duties are? I only know that
  she is pretty nearly always busy with something or other; and in the
  evening, of course, she is generally too tired to think of going out
  anywhere.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, but you must try to get her out. Next Tuesday, now,
  Judge &#8212;&#8212; is going to dine with us, and you know how
  amusing he is. If you have no other engagement, couldn&#39;t you
  bring Mrs. Lavender to dine with us on that evening?&quot;</p>

  <p>Now, on former occasions something of the same sort of invitation
  had frequently been given, and it was generally answered by Lavender
  giving an excuse for his wife, and promising to come himself. What
  was his astonishment to find Mrs. Lorraine plainly and most
  courteously intimating that the invitation was addressed distinctly
  to Mr. and Mrs. Lavender as a couple! When he regretted that Mrs.
  Lavender could not come, she said quietly, &quot;Oh, I am so sorry!
  You would have met an old friend of yours here, as well as the
  judge&#8212;Mr. Ingram.&quot;</p>

  <p>Lavender made no further sign of surprise or curiosity than to
  lift his eyebrows and say, &quot;Indeed!&quot;</p>

  <p>But when he left the house certain dark suspicions were troubling
  his mind. Nothing had been said as to the manner in which Ingram had
  made the acquaintance of Mrs. Kavanagh and her daughter, but there
  was that in Mrs. Lorraine&#39;s manner which convinced Lavender that
  something had happened. Had Ingram carried his interference to the
  extent of complaining to them? Had he overcome a repugnance which he
  had repeatedly admitted, and thrust himself upon these two people for
  this very purpose of making him, Lavender, odious and contemptible?
  Lavender&#39;s cheeks burned as he thought of this possibility. Mrs.
  Lorraine had been most courteous to him, but the longer he dwelt on
  these vague surmises the deeper grew his consciousness that he had
  been turned out of the place, morally <span class="pagenum">[pg
  477]</span> if not physically. What was that excess of courtesy but a
  cloak? If she had meant less, she would have been more careless; and
  all through the interview he had remarked that, instead of the free
  warfare of talk that generally went on between them, Mrs. Lorraine
  was most formally polite and apparently watchful of her words.</p>

  <p>He went home in a passion, which was all the more consuming that
  it could not be vented on any one. As Sheila had not spoken to
  Ingram&#8212;as she had even nerved herself to wound him by passing
  him without notice in the street&#8212;she could not be held
  responsible; and yet he wished that he could have upbraided some one
  for this mischief that had been done. Should he go straight down to
  Ingram&#39;s lodgings and have it out with him? At first he was
  strongly inclined to do so, but wiser counsels prevailed. Ingram had
  a keen and ready tongue, and a way of saying things that made them
  rankle afterward in the memory. Besides, he would go into court with
  a defective case. He could say nothing unless Ingram admitted that he
  had tried to poison the mind of Mrs. Lorraine against him; and of
  course if there was a quarrel, who would be so foolish as to make
  such an admission? Ingram would laugh at him, would refuse to admit
  or deny, would increase his anger without affording him an
  opportunity of revenging himself.</p>

  <p>Sheila could see that her husband was troubled, but could not
  divine the cause, and had long ago given up any habit of inquiry. He
  ate his dinner almost in silence, and then said he had to make a call
  on a friend, and that he would perhaps drop in to the club on his way
  home, so that she was not to sit up for him. She was not surprised or
  hurt at the announcement. She was accustomed to spend her evenings
  alone. She fetched down his cigar-case, put it in his top-coat pocket
  and brought him the coat. Then he kissed her and went out.</p>

  <p>But this evening, at least, she had; abundant occupation, and that
  of a sufficiently pleasant kind. For some little time she had been
  harboring in her mind a dark and mysterious plot, and she was glad of
  an opportunity to think it out and arrange its details. Mairi was
  coming to London, and she had carefully concealed the fact from her
  husband. A little surprise of a dramatic sort was to be prepared for
  him&#8212;with what result, who could tell? All of a sudden Lavender
  was to be precipitated into the island of Lewis as nearly as that
  could be imitated in a house at Notting Hill.</p>

  <p>This was Sheila&#39;s scheme, and on these lonely evenings she
  could sit by herself with much satisfaction and ponder over the
  little points of it and its possible success. Mairi was coming to
  London under the escort of a worthy Glasgow fishmonger whom Mr.
  Mackenzie knew. She would arrive after Lavender had left for his
  studio. Then she and Sheila would set to work to transform the
  smoking-room, that was sometimes called a library, into something
  resembling the quaint little drawing-room in Sheila&#39;s home. Mairi
  was bringing up a quantity of heather gathered fresh from the rocks
  beside the White Water; she was bringing up some peacocks&#39;
  feathers, too, for the mantelpiece, and two or three big shells; and,
  best of all, she was to put in her trunk a real and veritable lump of
  peat, well dried and easy to light. Then you must know that Sheila
  had already sketched out the meal that was to be placed on the table
  so soon as the room had been done up in Highland fashion and this
  peat lit so as to send its fragrant smoke abroad. A large salmon was
  to make its appearance first of all. There would be bottles of beer
  on the table; also one of those odd bottles of Norwegian make, filled
  with whisky. And when Lavender went with wonder into this small room,
  when he smelt the fragrant peat-smoke&#8212;and every one knows how
  powerful the sense of smell is in recalling bygone
  associations&#8212;when he saw the smoking salmon and the bottled
  beer and the whisky, and when he suddenly found Mairi coming into the
  room and saying to him, in her sweet Highland fashion, &quot;And are
  you ferry well, sir?&quot;&#8212;would <span class="pagenum">[pg
  478]</span> not his heart warm to the old ways and kindly homeliness
  of the house in Borva, and would not some glimpse of the happy and
  half-forgotten time that was now so sadly and strangely remote cause
  him to break down that barrier between himself and Sheila that this
  artificial life in the South had placed there?</p>

  <p>So the child dreamed, and was happy in dreaming of it. Sometimes
  she grew afraid of her project: she had not had much experience in
  deception, and the mere concealment of Mairi&#39;s coming was a hard
  thing to bear. But surely her husband would take this trick in good
  part. It was only, after all, a joke. To put a little barbaric
  splendor of decoration into the little smoking-room, to have a scent
  of peat-smoke in the air, and to have a timid, sweet-voiced, pretty
  Highland girl suddenly make her appearance, with an odor of the sea
  about her, as it were, and a look of fresh breezes in the color of
  her cheeks,&#8212;what mortal man could find fault with this innocent
  jest? Sheila&#39;s moments of doubt were succeeded by long hours of
  joyous confidence, in which a happy light shone on her face. She went
  through the house with a brisk step; she sang to herself as she went;
  she was kinder than ever to the small children who came into the
  square every forenoon, and whose acquaintance she had very speedily
  made; she gave each of her crossing-sweepers threepence instead of
  twopence in passing. The servants had never seen her in such good
  spirits; she was exceptionally generous in presenting them with
  articles of attire; they might have had half the week in holidays if
  Mr. Lavender had not to be attended to. A small gentleman of three
  years of age lived next door, and his acquaintance also she had made
  by means of his nurse. At this time his stock of toys, which Sheila
  had kept carefully renewed, became so big that he might, with proper
  management, have set up a stall in the Lowther Arcade. Just before
  she left Lewis her father had called her to him, and said,
  &quot;Sheila, I wass wanting to tell you about something. It is not
  every one that will care to hef his money given away to poor folk,
  and it wass many a time I said to myself that when you were married
  maybe your husband would think you were giving too much money to the
  poor folk, as you wass doing in Borva. And it iss this fifty pounds I
  hef got for you, Sheila, in ten banknotes, and you will take them
  with you for your own money, that you will not hef any trouble about
  giving things to people. And when the fifty pounds will be done, I
  will send you another fifty pounds; and it will be no difference to
  me whatever. And if there is any one in Borva you would be for
  sending money to, there is your own money; for there is many a one
  would take the money from Sheila Mackenzie that would not be for
  taking it from an English stranger in London. And when you will send
  it to them, you will send it to me; and I will tek it to them, and
  will tell them that this money is from my Sheila, and from no one
  else whatever.&quot;</p>

  <p>This was all the dowry that Sheila carried with her to the South.
  Mackenzie would willingly have given her half his money, if she would
  have taken it or if her husband had desired it; but the old King of
  Borva had profound and far-reaching schemes in his head about the
  small fortune he might otherwise have accorded to his daughter. This
  wealth, such as it was, was to be a magnet to draw this young English
  gentleman back to the Hebrides. It was all very well for Mr. Lavender
  to have plenty of money at present: he might not always have it. Then
  the time would come for Mackenzie to say, &quot;Look here, young man:
  I can support myself easily and comfortably by my farming and
  fishing. The money I have saved is at your disposal so long as you
  consent to remain in Lewis&#8212;in Stornoway if you please,
  elsewhere if you please&#8212;only in Lewis. And while you are
  painting pictures, and making as much money as you can that way, you
  can have plenty of fishing and shooting and amusement; and my guns
  and boats and rods are all at your service.&quot; Mr. Mackenzie
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 479]</span> considered that no man could
  resist such an offer.</p>

  <p>Sheila, of course, told her husband of the sum of money she owned,
  and for a longtime it was a standing joke between them. He addressed
  her with much respect, and was careful to inform her of the
  fluctuations of the moneymarket. Sometimes he borrowed a sovereign of
  her, and never without giving her an I O U, which was faithfully
  reclaimed. But by and by she perceived that he grew less and less to
  like the mention of this money. Perhaps it resembled too closely the
  savings which the overcautious folks about Borvabost would not
  entrust to a bank, but kept hid about their huts in the heel of a
  stocking. At all events, Sheila saw that her husband did not like her
  to go to this fund for her charities; and so the fifty pounds that
  her father had given her lasted a long time. During this period of
  jubilation, in which she looked forward to touching her husband&#39;s
  heart by an innocent little stratagem, more frequent appeals were
  made to the drawer in which the treasure was locked up, so that in
  the end her private dowry was reduced to thirty pounds.</p>

  <p>If Ingram could have but taken part in this plan of hers! The only
  regret that was mingled with her anticipations of a happier future
  concerned this faithful friend of hers, who seemed to have been cut
  off from them for ever. And it soon became apparent to her that her
  husband, so far from inclining to forget the misunderstanding that
  had arisen between Ingram and himself, seemed to feel increased
  resentment, insomuch that she was most careful to avoid mentioning
  his name.</p>

  <p>She was soon to meet him, however. Lavender was resolved that he
  would not appear to have retired from the field merely because Ingram
  had entered it. He would go to this dinner on the Tuesday evening,
  and Sheila would accompany him. First, he asked her. Much as she
  would have preferred not visiting these particular people, she
  cheerfully acquiesced: she was not going to be churlish or
  inconsiderate on the very eve of her dramatic <i>coup</i>. Then he
  went to Mrs. Lorraine and said he had persuaded Sheila to come with
  him; and the young American lady and her mamma were good enough to
  say how glad they were she had come to this decision. They appeared
  to take it for granted that it was Sheila alone who had declined
  former invitations.</p>

  <p>&quot;Mr. Ingram will be there on Tuesday evening,&quot; said
  Lavender to his wife.</p>

  <p>&quot;I was not aware he knew them,&quot; said Sheila,
  remembering, indeed, how scrupulously Ingram had refused to know
  them.</p>

  <p>&quot;He has made their acquaintance for his own purposes,
  doubtless,&quot; said Lavender. &quot;I suppose he will appear in a
  frock-coat, with a bright blue tie, and he will say &#39;Sir&#39; to
  the waiters when he does not understand them.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I thought you said Mr. Ingram belonged to a very good
  family,&quot; said Sheila quietly.</p>

  <p>&quot;That is so. But each man is responsible for his own manners;
  and as all the society he sees consists of a cat and some wooden
  pipes in a couple of dingy rooms in Sloane street, you can&#39;t
  expect him not to make an ass of himself.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I have never seen him make himself ridiculous: I do not
  think it possible,&quot; said Sheila, with a certain precision of
  speech which Lavender had got to know meant much. &quot;But that is a
  matter for himself. Perhaps you will tell me what I am to do when I
  meet him at Mrs. Kavanagh&#39;s house.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Of course you must meet him as you would any one else you
  know. If you don&#39;t wish to speak to him, you need not do so.
  Saying &#39;Good-evening&#39; costs nothing.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If he takes me into dinner?&quot; she asked calmly.</p>

  <p>&quot;Then you must talk to him as you would to any
  stranger,&quot; he said impatiently. &quot;Ask him if he has been to
  the opera, and he won&#39;t know there is no opera going on. Tell him
  that town is very full, and he won&#39;t know that everybody has
  left. Say you may meet him again at Mrs. Kavanagh&#39;s, and
  you&#39;ll see that he doesn&#39;t know they mean to <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 480]</span> start for the Tyrol in a fortnight. I think
  you and I must also be settling soon where we mean to go. I don&#39;t
  think we could do better than go to the Tyrol.&quot;</p>

  <p>She did not answer. It was clear that he had given up all
  intention of going up to Lewis, for that year at least. But she would
  not beg him to alter his decision just yet. Mairi was coming, and
  that experiment of the enchanted room had still to be tried.</p>

  <p>As they drove round to Mrs. Kavanagh&#39;s house on that Tuesday
  evening, she thought, with much bitterness of heart, of the
  possibility of her having to meet Mr. Ingram in the fashion her
  husband had suggested. Would it not be better, if he did take her in
  to dinner, to throw herself entirely on his mercy, and ask him not to
  talk to her at all? She would address herself, when there was a
  chance, to her neighbor on the other side: if she remained silent
  altogether, no great harm would be done.</p>

  <p>When she went into the drawing-room her first glance round was for
  him, and he was the first person whom she saw; for, instead of
  withdrawing into a corner to make one neighbor the victim of his
  shyness, or concealing his embarrassment in studying the photographic
  albums, Mr. Ingram was coolly standing on the hearth-rug, with both
  hands in his trousers pockets, while he was engaged in giving the
  American judge a great deal of authoritative information about
  America. The judge was a tall, fair, stout, good-natured man, fond of
  joking and a good dinner, and he was content at this moment to sit
  quietly in an easy-chair, with a pleasant smile on his face, and be
  lectured about his own country by this sallow little man, whom he
  took to be a professor of modern history at some college or
  other.</p>

  <p>Ingram, as soon as he found that Sheila was in the room, relieved
  her from any doubt as to his intentions. He merely came forward,
  shook hands with her, and said, &quot;How do you do, Mrs.
  Lavender?&quot; and went back to the judge. She might have been an
  acquaintance of yesterday or a friend of twenty years&#39; standing:
  no one could tell by his manner. As for Sheila, she parted with his
  hand reluctantly. She tried to look, too, what she dared not say; but
  whatever of regret and kindness and assurance of friendship was in
  her eyes he did not see. He scarcely glanced at her face: he went off
  at once, and plunged again into the Cincinnati Convention.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Kavanagh and Mrs. Lorraine were exceedingly and almost
  obtrusively kind to her, but she scarcely heard what they said to
  her. It seemed so strange and so sad to her that her old friend
  should be standing near her, and she so far removed from him that she
  dared not go and speak to him. She could not understand it sometimes:
  everything around her seemed to get confused, until she felt as if
  she were sinking in a great sea, and could utter but one despairing
  cry as she saw the light disappear above her head. When they went in
  to dinner she saw that Mr. Ingram&#39;s seat was on Mrs.
  Lorraine&#39;s right hand, and, although she could hear him speak, as
  he was almost right opposite to her, it seemed to her that his voice
  sounded as if it were far away. The man who had taken her in was a
  tall, brown-whiskered and faultlessly-dressed person who never spoke,
  so that she was allowed to sit and listen to the conversation between
  Mrs. Lorraine and Ingram. They appeared to be on excellent terms. You
  would have fancied they had known each other for years. And as Sheila
  sat and saw how preoccupied and pleased with his companion Mr. Ingram
  was, perhaps now and again the bitter question arose to her mind
  whether this woman, who had taken away her husband, was seeking to
  take away her friend also. Sheila knew nothing of all that had
  happened within these past few days. She knew only that she was
  alone, without either husband or friend, and it seemed to her that
  this pale American girl had taken both away from her.</p>

  <p>Ingram was in one of his happiest moods, and was seeking to prove
  to Mrs. <span class="pagenum">[pg 481]</span> Lorraine that this
  present dinner-party ought to be an especially pleasant one.
  Everybody was going away somewhere, and of course she must know that
  the expectation of traveling was much more delightful than the
  reality of it. What could surpass the sense of freedom, of power, of
  hope enjoyed by the happy folks who sat down to an open atlas and
  began to sketch out routes for their coming holidays? Where was he
  going? Oh, he was going to the North. Had Mrs. Lorraine never seen
  Edinburgh Castle rising out of a gray fog, like the ghost of some
  great building belonging to the times of Arthurian romance? Had she
  never seen the northern twilights, and the awful gloom and wild
  colors of Loch Coruisk and the Skye hills? There was no
  holiday-making so healthy, so free from restraint, as that among the
  far Highland hills and glens, where the clear mountain-air, scented
  with miles and miles of heather, seemed to produce a sort of
  intoxication of good spirits within one. Then the yachting round the
  wonderful islands of the West&#8212;the rapid runs of a bright
  forenoon, the shooting of the wild sea-birds, the scrambled dinners
  in the small cabin, the still nights in the small harbors, with a
  scent of sea-weed abroad, and the white stars shining down on the
  trembling water. Yes, he was going yachting this autumn: in about a
  fortnight he hoped to start. His friend was at present away up Loch
  Boisdale, in South Uist, and he did not know how to get there except
  by going to Skye, and taking his chance of some boat going over.
  Where would they go then? He did not know. Wherever his friend liked.
  It would be enough for him if they kept always moving about, seeing
  the strange sights of the sea and the air and the lonely shores of
  those northern islands. Perhaps they might even try to reach St.
  Kilda&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, Mr. Ingram, won&#39;t you go and see my papa?&quot;</p>

  <p>The cry that suddenly reached him was like the cry of a broken
  heart. He started as from a trance, and found Sheila regarding him
  with a piteous appeal in her face: she had been listening intently to
  all he had said.</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh yes, Sheila,&quot; he said kindly, and quite forgetting
  that he was speaking to her before strangers: &quot;of course I must
  go and see your papa if we are any way near the Lewis. Perhaps you
  may be there then?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Sheila, looking down.</p>

  <p>&quot;Won&#39;t you go to the Highlands this autumn?&quot; Mrs.
  Lorraine asked in a friendly way.</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Sheila in a measured voice as she looked her
  enemy fair in the face: &quot;I think we are going to the
  Tyrol.&quot;</p>

  <p>If the child had only known what occurred to Mrs. Lorraine&#39;s
  mind at this moment! Not a triumphant sense of Lavender&#39;s
  infatuation, as Sheila probably fancied, but a very definite
  resolution that if Frank Lavender went to the Tyrol, it was not with
  either her or her mother he should go.</p>

  <p>&quot;Mrs. Lavender&#39;s father is an old friend of mine,&quot;
  said Ingram, loud enough for all to hear; &quot;and, hospitable as
  all Highlanders are, I have never met his equal in that way, and I
  have tried his patience a good many times. What do you think, Mrs.
  Lorraine, of a man who would give up his best gun to you, even though
  you couldn&#39;t shoot a bit, and he particularly proud of his
  shooting? And so if you lived with him for a month or six
  months&#8212;each day the best of everything for you, the second best
  for your friend, the worst for himself. Wasn&#39;t it so,
  Lavender?&quot;</p>

  <p>It was a direct challenge sent across the table, and Sheila&#39;s
  heart beat quick lest her husband should say something
  ungracious.</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, certainly,&quot; said Lavender with a readiness that
  pleased Sheila. &quot;I, at least, have no right to complain of his
  hospitality.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Your papa is a very handsome man,&quot; said Mrs. Lorraine
  to Sheila, bringing the conversation back to their own end of the
  table. &quot;I have seen few finer heads than that drawing you have.
  Mr. Lavender did that, did he not? Why has he never done one of
  you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He is too busy, I think, just now,&quot; <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 482]</span> Sheila said, perhaps not knowing that from
  Mrs. Lorraine&#39;s waist-belt at that moment depended a fan which
  might have given evidence as to the extreme scarcity of time under
  which Lavender was supposed to labor.</p>

  <p>&quot;He has a splendid head,&quot; said Ingram. &quot;Did you
  know that he is called the King of Borva up there?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I have heard of him being called the King of Thule,&quot;
  said Mrs. Lorraine, turning with a smile to Sheila, &quot;and of his
  daughter being styled a princess. Do you know the ballad of the King
  of Thule in <i>Faust</i>, Mrs. Lavender?&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In the opera?&#8212;yes,&quot; said Sheila.</p>

  <p>&quot;Will you sing it for us after dinner?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If you like.&quot;</p>

  <p>The promise was fulfilled, in a fashion. The notion that Mr.
  Ingram was about to go away up to Lewis, to the people who knew her
  and to her father&#39;s house, with no possible answer to the
  questions which would certainly be showered upon him as to why she
  had not come also, troubled Sheila deeply. The ladies went into the
  drawing-room, and Mrs. Lorraine got out the song. Sheila sat down to
  the piano, thinking far more of that small stone house at Borva than
  of the King of Thule&#39;s castle overlooking the sea; and yet
  somehow the first lines of the song, though she knew them well
  enough, sent a pang to her heart as she glanced at them. She touched
  the first notes of the accompaniment, and she looked at the words
  again:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i2">Over the sea, in Thule of old,</p>

    <p class="i2">Reigned a king who was true-hearted,</p>

    <p class="i2">Who, in remembrance of one departed&#8212;</p>
  </div>

  <p>A mist came over her eyes. Was she the one who had departed,
  leaving the old king in his desolate house by the sea, where he could
  only think of her as he sat in his solitary chamber, with the
  night-winds howling round the shore outside? When her birthday had
  come round she knew that he must have silently drank to her, though
  not out of a beaker of gold. And now, when mere friends and
  acquaintances were free to speed away to the North, and get a welcome
  from the folks in Borva, and listen to the Atlantic waves dashing
  lightly in among the rocks, her hope of getting thither had almost
  died out. Among such people as landed on Stornoway quay from the big
  Clansman her father would seek one face, and seek it in vain. And
  Duncan and Scarlett, and even John the Piper&#8212;all the
  well-remembered folks who lived far away across the Minch&#8212;they
  would ask why Miss Sheila was never coming back.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lorraine had been standing aside from the piano. Noticing
  that Sheila had played the introduction to the song twice over in an
  undetermined manner, she came forward a step or two and pretended to
  be looking at the music. Tears were running down Sheila&#39;s face.
  Mrs. Lorraine put her hand on the girl&#39;s shoulder, and sheltered
  her from observation, and said aloud, &quot;You have it in a
  different key, have you not? Pray don&#39;t sing it. Sing something
  else. Do you know any of Gounod&#39;s sacred songs? Let me see if we
  can find anything for you in this volume.&quot;</p>

  <p>They were a long time finding anything in that volume. When they
  did find it, behold! it was one of Mrs. Lorraine&#39;s songs, and
  that young lady said if Mrs. Lavender would only allow herself to be
  superseded for a few minutes&#8212;And so Sheila walked, with her
  head down, to the conservatory, which was at the other end of the
  piano; and Mrs. Lorraine not only sung this French song, but sang
  every one of the verses; and at the end of it she had quite forgotten
  that Sheila had promised to sing.</p>

  <p>&quot;You are very sensitive,&quot; she said to Sheila, coming
  into the conservatory.</p>

  <p>&quot;I am very stupid,&quot; Sheila said with her face burning.
  &quot;But it is a long time since I will see the Highlands&#8212;and
  Mr. Ingram was talking of the places I know&#8212;and&#8212;and
  so&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I understand well enough,&quot; said Mrs. Lorraine tenderly,
  as if Sheila were a mere child in her hands. &quot;But you must not
  get your eyes red. You have to sing some of those Highland songs for
  us yet, when the gentlemen come in. Come up to my room and I will
  make your eyes all right. Oh, do not be afraid! I shall not bring you
  down like Lady <span class="pagenum">[pg 483]</span> Leveret. Did you
  ever see anything like that woman&#39;s face to-night? It reminds me
  of the window of an oil-and-color shop. I wonder she does not catch
  flies with her cheeks.&quot;</p>

  <p>So all the people, Sheila learned that night, were going away from
  London, and soon she and her husband would join in the general
  stampede of the very last dwellers in town. But Mairi? What was to
  become of her after that little plot had been played out? Sheila
  could not leave Mairi to see London by herself: she had been enjoying
  beforehand the delight of taking the young girl about and watching
  the wonder of her eyes. Nor could she fairly postpone Mairi&#39;s
  visit, and Mairi was coming up in another couple of days.</p>

  <p>On the morning on which the visitor from the far Hebrides was to
  make her appearance in London, Sheila felt conscious of a great
  hypocrisy in bidding good-bye to her husband. On some excuse or other
  she had had breakfast ordered early, and he found himself ready at
  half-past nine to go out for the day.</p>

  <p>&quot;Frank,&quot; she said, &quot;will you come in to lunch at
  two?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why?&quot; he asked: he did not often have luncheon at
  home.</p>

  <p>&quot;I will go into the Park with you in the afternoon if you
  like,&quot; she said: all the scene had been diligently rehearsed on
  one side, before.</p>

  <p>Lavender was a little surprised, but he was in an amiable
  mood.</p>

  <p>&quot;All right!&quot; he said. &quot;Have something with olives
  in it. Two, sharp.&quot;</p>

  <p>With that he went out, and Sheila, with a wild commotion at her
  heart, saw him walk away through the square. She was afraid Mairi
  might have arrived before he left. And, indeed, he had not gone above
  a few minutes when a four-wheeler drove up, and an elderly man got
  out and waited for the timid-faced girl inside to alight. With a rush
  like that of a startled deer, Sheila was down the stairs, along the
  hall and on the pavement; and it was, &quot;Oh, Mairi! and have you
  come at last? And are you very well? And how are all the people in
  Borva? And Mr. M&#39;Alpine, how are you? and will you come into the
  house?&quot;</p>

  <p>Certainly, that was a strange sight for a decorous London
  square&#8212;the mistress of a house, a young girl with bare head,
  coming out on the pavement to shake hands in a frantic fashion with a
  young maid-servant and an elderly man whose clothes had been pretty
  well tanned by sunlight and sea-water! And Sheila would herself help
  to carry Mairi&#39;s luggage in. And she would take no denial from
  Mr. M&#39;Alpine, whose luggage was also carried in. And she would
  herself pay the cabman, as strangers did not know about these things,
  Sheila&#39;s knowledge being exhibited by her hastily giving the man
  five shillings for driving from Euston Station. And there was
  breakfast waiting for them both as soon as Mairi could get her face
  washed; and would Mr. M&#39;Alpine have a glass of whisky after the
  night&#39;s traveling?&#8212;and it was very good whisky whatever, as
  it had come all the way from Stornoway. Mr. M&#39;Alpine was nothing
  loath.</p>

  <p>&quot;And wass you pretty well, Miss Sheila?&quot; said Mairi,
  looking timidly and hastily up, and forgetting altogether that Sheila
  had another name now. &quot;It will be a great thing for me to go
  back to sa Lewis, and tell them I wass seeing you, and you wass
  looking so well. And I will be thinking I wass neffer coming to any
  one I knew any more; and it is a great fright I hef had since we came
  away from sa Lewis; and I wass thinking we would neffer find you
  among all sa people and so far away across sa sea and sa land.
  Eh&#8212;!&quot; The girl stopped in astonishment. Her eyes had
  wandered up to a portrait on the walls; and here, in this very room,
  after she had traveled over all this great distance, apparently
  leaving behind her everything but the memory of her home, was Mr.
  Mackenzie himself, looking at her from under his shaggy eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&quot;You must have seen that picture in Borva, Mairi,&quot;
  Sheila said. &quot;Now come with me, like a good girl, and get
  yourself ready for breakfast. Do you know, Mairi, it does my heart
  good to hear you <span class="pagenum">[pg 484]</span> talk again? I
  don&#39;t think I shall be able to let you go back to the
  Lewis.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But you hef changed ferry much in your way of speaking,
  Miss&#8212;Mrs. Lavender,&quot; said Mairi with an effort. &quot;You
  will speak just like sa English now.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The English don&#39;t say so,&quot; replied Sheila with a
  smile, leading the way up stairs.</p>

  <p>Mr. M&#39;Alpine had his business to attend to, but, being a
  sensible man, he took advantage of the profuse breakfast placed
  before him. Mairi was a little too frightened and nervous and happy
  to eat much, but Mr. M&#39;Alpine was an old traveler, not to be put
  out by the mere meeting of two girls. He listened in a grave and
  complacent manner to the rapid questions and answers of Mairi and her
  hostess, but he himself was too busy to join in the conversation
  much. At the end of breakfast he accepted, after a little pressing,
  half a glass of whisky; and then, much comforted and in a thoroughly
  good-humor with himself and the world, got his luggage out again and
  went on his way toward a certain inn in High Holborn.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay, and where does the queen live, Miss Sheila?&quot; said
  Mairi. She had been looking at the furniture in Sheila&#39;s house,
  and wondering if the queen lived in a place still more beautiful than
  this.</p>

  <p>&quot;A long way from here.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And it iss no wonder,&quot; said Mairi, &quot;she will
  neffer hef been in sa Lewis. I wass neffer thinking the world wass so
  big, and it wass many a time since me and Mr. M&#39;Alpine hef come
  away from Styornoway I wass thinking it wass too far for me effer to
  get back again. But it is many a one will say to me, before I hef
  left the Lewis, that I wass not to come home unless you wass coming
  too, and I wass to bring you back with me, Miss Sheila. And where is
  Bras, Miss Sheila?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You will see him by and by. He is out in the garden
  now.&quot; She said &quot;gyarden&quot; without knowing it.</p>

  <p>&quot;And will he understood the Gaelic yet?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Sheila said. &quot;And he is sure to remember
  you.&quot;</p>

  <p>There was no mistake about that. When Mairi went into the back
  garden the demonstrations of delight on the part of the great
  deerhound were as pronounced as his dignity and gravity would allow.
  And Mairi fairly fell upon his neck and kissed him, and addressed to
  him a hundred endearing phrases in Gaelic, every word of which it was
  quite obvious that the dog understood. London was already beginning
  to be less terrible to her. She had met and talked with Sheila. Here
  was Bras. A portrait of the King of Borva was hung up inside, and all
  round the rooms were articles which she had known in the North,
  before Sheila had married and brought them away into this strange
  land.</p>

  <p>&quot;You have never asked after my husband, Mairi,&quot; said
  Sheila, thinking she would confuse the girl.</p>

  <p>But Mairi was not confused. Probably she had been fancying that
  Mr. Lavender was down at the shore, or had gone out fishing, or
  something of that sort, and would return soon enough. It was Sheila,
  not he, whom she was concerned about. Indeed, Mairi had caught up a
  little of that jealousy of Lavender which was rife among the Borva
  folks. They would speak no ill of Mr. Lavender. The young gentleman
  whom Miss Sheila had chosen had by that very fact a claim upon their
  respect. Mr. Mackenzie&#39;s son-in-law was a person of importance.
  And yet in their secret hearts they bore a grudge against him. What
  right had he to come away up to the North and carry off the very
  pride of the island? Were English girls not good enough for him, that
  he must needs come up and take away Sheila Mackenzie, and keep her
  there in the South so that her friends and acquaintances saw no more
  of her? Before the marriage Mairi had a great liking and admiration
  for Mr. Lavender. She was so pleased to see Miss Sheila pleased that
  she approved of the young man, and thanked him in her heart for
  making her cousin and mistress so obviously happy. Perhaps, indeed,
  Mairi managed to fall in love with him a little bit herself, merely
  by force of example and through sympathy with Sheila; and
  <span class="pagenum">[pg 485]</span> she was rapidly forming very
  good opinions of the English race and their ways and their looks. But
  when Lavender took away Sheila from Borva a change came over
  Mairi&#39;s sentiments. She gradually fell in with the current
  opinions of the island&#8212;that it was a great pity Sheila had not
  married young Mr. Maclntyre of Sutherland, or some one who would have
  allowed her to remain among her own people. Mairi began to think that
  the English, though they were handsome and good-natured and free with
  their money, were on the whole a selfish race, inconsiderate and
  forgetful of promises. She began to dislike the English, and wished
  they would stay in their own country, and not interfere with other
  people.</p>

  <p>&quot;I hope he is very well,&quot; said Mairi dutifully: she
  could at least say that honestly.</p>

  <p>&quot;You will see him at two o&#39;clock. He is coming in to
  luncheon; and he does not know you are here, and you are to be a
  great surprise to him, Mairi. And there is to be a greater surprise
  still; for we are going to make one of the rooms into the
  drawing-room at home; and you must open your boxes, and bring me down
  the heather and the peat, Mairi, and the two bottles; and then, you
  know, when the salmon is on the table, and the whisky and the beer,
  and Bras lying on the hearth-rug, and the peat-smoke all through the
  room, then you will come in and shake hands with him, and he will
  think he is in Borva again.&quot;</p>

  <p>Mairi was a little puzzled. She did not understand the intention
  of this strange thing. But she went and fetched the materials she had
  brought with her from Lewis, and Sheila and she set to work.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant enough occupation for this bright forenoon, and
  Sheila, as she heard Mairi&#39;s sweet Highland speech, and as she
  brought from all parts of the house the curiosities sent her from the
  Hebrides, would almost have fancied she was superintending a
  &quot;cleaning&quot; of that museum-like little drawing-room at
  Borva. Skins of foxes, seals and deer, stuffed eagles and strange
  fishes, masses of coral and wonderful carvings in wood brought from
  abroad, shells of every size from every clime,&#8212;all these were
  brought together into Frank Lavender&#39;s smoking-room. The ordinary
  ornaments of the mantelpiece gave way to fanciful arrangements of
  peacocks&#39; feathers. Fresh-blown ling and the beautiful spikes of
  the bell-heather formed the staple of the decorations, and Mairi had
  brought enough to adorn an assembly-room.</p>

  <p>&quot;That is like the Lewis people,&quot; Sheila said with a
  laugh: she had not been in as happy a mood for many a day. &quot;I
  asked you to bring one peat, and of course you brought two. Tell the
  truth, Mairi: could you have forced yourself to bring one
  peat?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I wass thinking it was safer to bring sa two,&quot; replied
  Mairi, blushing all over the fair and pretty face.</p>

  <p>And indeed, there being two peats, Sheila thought she might as
  well try an experiment with one. She crumbled down some pieces, put
  them on a plate, lit them, and placed the plate outside the open
  window, on the sill. Presently a new, sweet, half-forgotten fragrance
  came floating in, and Sheila almost forgot the success of the
  experiment in the half-delighted, half-sad reminiscences called up by
  the scent of the peat. Mairi failed to see how any one could
  willfully smoke a house&#8212;any one, that is to say, who did not
  save the smoke for his thatch. And who was so particular as Sheila
  had been about having the clothes come in from the washing dried so
  that they should not retain this very odor that seemed now to delight
  her?</p>

  <p>At last the room was finished, and Sheila contemplated it with
  much satisfaction. The table was laid, and on the white cloth stood
  the bottles most familiar to Borva. The peat-smoke still lingered in
  the air: she could not have wished anything to be better.</p>

  <p>Then she went off to look after the luncheon, and Mairi was
  permitted to go down and explore the mysteries of the kitchen. The
  servants were not accustomed to this interference and oversight, and
  might have resented it, only that <span class="pagenum">[pg
  486]</span> Sheila had proved a very good mistress to them, and had
  shown, too, that she would have her own way when she wanted it.
  Suddenly, as Sheila was explaining to Mairi the use of some
  particular piece of mechanism, she heard a sound that made her heart
  jump. It was now but half-past one, and yet that was surely her
  husband&#39;s foot in the hall. For a moment she was too bewildered
  to know what to do. She heard him go straight into the very room she
  had been decorating, the door of which she had left open. Then, as
  she went up stairs, with her heart still beating fast, the first
  thing that met her eye was a tartan shawl belonging to Mairi that had
  been accidentally left in the passage. Her husband must have seen
  it.</p>

  <p>&quot;Sheila, what nonsense is this?&quot; he said.</p>

  <p>He was evidently in a hurry, and yet she could not answer: her
  heart was throbbing too quickly.</p>

  <p>&quot;Look here,&quot; he said: &quot;I wish you&#39;d give up
  this grotto-making till to-morrow. Mrs. Kavanagh, Mrs. Lorraine and
  Lord Arthur Redmond are coming here to luncheon at two. I suppose you
  can get something decent for them. What is the matter? What is the
  meaning of all this?&quot;</p>

  <p>And then his eyes rested on the tartan shawl, which he had really
  not noticed before.</p>

  <p>&quot;Who is in the house?&quot; he said. &quot;Have you asked
  some washerwoman to lunch?&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila managed at last to say, &quot;It is Mairi come from
  Stornoway. I was thinking you would be surprised to see her when you
  came in.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And these preparations are for her?&quot;</p>

  <p>Sheila said nothing: there was that in the tone of her
  husband&#39;s voice which was gradually bringing her to herself, and
  giving her quite sufficient firmness.</p>

  <p>&quot;And now that this girl has come up, I suppose you mean to
  introduce her to all your friends; and I suppose you expect those
  people who are coming in half an hour to sit down at table with a
  kitchen-maid?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Mairi,&quot; said Sheila, standing quite erect, but with her
  eyes cast down, &quot;is my cousin.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Your cousin! Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Sheila. You know very
  well that Mairi is nothing more or less than a scullery-maid; and I
  suppose you mean to take her out of the kitchen and introduce her to
  people, and expect her to sit down at table with them. Is not that
  so?&quot; She did not answer, and he went on impatiently: &quot;Why
  was I not told that this girl was coming to stay at my house? Surely
  I have some right to know what guests you invite, that I may be able
  at least to ask my friends not to come near the house while they are
  in it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That I did not tell you before&#8212;yes, that was a
  pity,&quot; said Sheila, sadly and calmly. &quot;But it will be no
  trouble to you. When Mrs. Lorraine comes up at two o&#39;clock there
  will be luncheon for her and for her friends. She will not have to
  sit down with any of my relations or with me, for if they are not fit
  to meet her, I am not; and it is not any great matter that I do not
  meet her at two o&#39;clock.&quot;</p>

  <p>There was no passion of any sort in the measured and sad voice,
  nor in the somewhat pale face and downcast eyes. Perhaps it was this
  composure that deceived Frank Lavender: at all events, he turned and
  walked out of the house, satisfied that he would not have to
  introduce this Highland cousin to his friends, and just as certain
  that Sheila would repent of her resolve and appear in the dining-room
  as usual.</p>

  <p>Sheila went down stairs to the kitchen, where Mairi still stood
  awaiting her. She gave orders to one of the servants about having
  luncheon laid in the dining-room at two, and then she bade Mairi
  follow her up stairs.</p>

  <p>&quot;Mairi,&quot; she said, when they were alone, &quot;I want
  you to put your things in your trunk at once&#8212;in five minutes if
  you can: I shall be waiting for you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Miss Sheila!&quot; cried the girl, looking up to her
  friend&#39;s face with a sudden fright seizing her heart, &quot;what
  is the matter with you? You are going to die!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;There is nothing the matter, Mairi. I am going
  away.&quot;</p><span class="pagenum">[pg 487]</span>

  <p>She uttered the words placidly, but there was a pained look about
  the lips that could not be concealed, and her face, unknown to
  herself, had the whiteness of despair in it.</p>

  <p>&quot;Going away!&quot; said Mairi, in a bewildered way.
  &quot;Where are you going, Miss Sheila?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I will tell you by and by. Get your trunk ready, Mairi. You
  are keeping me waiting.&quot;</p>

  <p>Then she called for a servant, who was sent for a cab; and by the
  time the vehicle appeared Mairi was ready to get into it, and her
  trunk was put on the top. Then, clad in the rough blue dress that she
  used to wear in Borva, and with no appearance of haste or fear in the
  calm and death-like face, Sheila came out from her husband&#39;s
  house and found herself alone in the world. There were two little
  girls, the daughters of a neighbor, passing by at the time: she
  patted them on the head and bade them good-morning. Could she
  recollect, five minutes thereafter, having seen them? There was a
  strange and distant look in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She got into the cab and sat down by Mairi, and then took the
  girl&#39;s hand. &quot;I am sorry to take you away, Mairi,&quot; she
  said; but she was apparently not thinking of Mairi, nor of the house
  she was leaving, nor yet of the vehicle in which she was so strangely
  placed. Was she thinking of a certain wild and wet day in the far
  Hebrides, when a young bride stood on the decks of a great vessel and
  saw the home of her childhood and the friends of her youth fade back
  into the desolate waste of the sea? Perhaps there may have been some
  unconscious influence in this picture to direct her movements at this
  moment, for of definite resolves she had none. When Mairi told her
  that the cabman wanted to know whither he was to drive, she merely
  answered, &quot;Oh yes, Mairi, we will go to the station;&quot; and
  Mairi added, addressing the man, &quot;It was the Euston
  Station.&quot; Then they drove away.</p>

  <p>&quot;Are you going home?&quot; said the young girl, looking up
  with a strange foreboding and sinking of the heart to the pale face
  and distant eyes&#8212;&quot;Are you going home, Miss
  Sheila?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh yes, we are going home, Mairi,&quot; was the answer she
  got, but the tone in which it was uttered filled her mind with doubt,
  and something like despair.</p>

  <h2>OUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.</h2>

  <h3><a name="calcutta" id="calcutta"><!-- H2 anchor --></a> AN
  EVENING IN CALCUTTA.</h3>

  <p>About six o&#39;clock every evening the beau monde of Calcutta
  begins to take the air on the Course, a very pleasant drive which
  runs along the bank of the river. It is usually crowded with
  carriages, but it must be confessed that none of them would be likely
  to excite the envy of an owner of a fashionable turn-out at home,
  unless indeed it might be now and then for the sake of the
  occupants.</p>

  <p>Long before the Course begins to thin it is almost dark, and then,
  if the poor lounger is &quot;unattached,&quot; and is sharing his
  buggy with a friend as unfortunate as himself, the general effect of
  the scene before him is the most interesting object for his gaze. The
  carriages continue to whirl past, but one sees hardly more of them
  than their lamps. The river glides, cold and shining, a long silvery
  light under the opposite bank, while trees and masts and rigging
  relieve themselves against the golden bars of the distant sky. But
  the band ceases to play, and every one goes home to dress.</p>

  <p>If the traveler chooses, he may find many an amusing drive in the
  native parts of the town. Tall Sikhs, whose hair and beards have
  never known scissors or razor, and who stride along with a swagger
  and high-caste dignity; effeminate Cingalese; Hindoo clerks,
  smirking, conceited and dandified too, according to their own
  notions; almost naked palkee-bearers, who nevertheless, if there is
  the slightest shower, put up an umbrella to protect their shaven
  crowns; up-country girls with rings in their noses and rings on their
  toes; little Bengalee beauties; Parsees, Chinese, Greeks, Jews and
  Armenians, in every variety of costume, are to be seen bargaining on
  the quays, chaffering in the bazaars, loading and unloading the
  ships, trotting along under their water-skins, driving their
  bullock-carts, smoking their hookahs or squatting in the shade.</p>

  <p>We have had the good fortune, thanks to our interest in native
  manners and customs, to make the acquaintance of a Hindoo merchant, a
  millionaire and a <span class="pagenum">[pg 489]</span> <i>bon
  vivant</i>, on whom his religion sits somewhat lightly. We might, if
  we had not been otherwise engaged, have dined with him this evening.
  He would have been delighted to receive us, and would have treated us
  with abundant hospitality and kindness. The dinner would have been of
  a composite character, partly European, partly native. A sort of
  rissole of chicken would certainly have been one of the dishes, and
  with equal certainty would have met with your approval: the curry,
  too, would have satisfied you, even if you had just come from Madras
  or Singapore. There would have been knives and forks for us: our
  convives would not have made much use of the latter, and some of the
  dishes on which they would have exercised their fingers would hardly
  have tempted us. The champagne and claret are excellent, and our
  host, Hindoo as he is, is not sparing in his libations; and at the
  same time he and his countrymen would have been vociferous in
  pressing us to eat and drink, filling our glasses the moment they
  were empty, and heaping our plates with the choicest morsels. After
  all, however, perhaps we have had no great loss in missing the
  dinner. We shall enjoy the pleasant drive, and by being a little late
  shall escape the not very delightful sound of various stringed
  instruments being tuned. Arrived, we leave our horse and buggy to the
  care of some most cutthroat-looking individuals, who crowd round with
  much noise and gesticulation, wondering who and what we are, while
  the noise brings out a sort of majordomo, who recognizes us as
  friends of the master, and soon clears a way for us across the
  courtyard, takes us up a flight of steps, and ushers us into a long
  and tolerably well-lighted room. Our host comes forward with
  outstretched hands, and with great cordiality welcomes and presents
  us to his friends. We can&#39;t understand all he says, for his
  English at the best is not always intelligible, and he is now
  particularly talkative and jolly: it is evident he has dined. There
  is a great noise; every one is talking and laughing; and the talking
  is loud, for it has to overcome the sounds made by sundry musicians
  seated at the other end of the room, who are striking their tomtoms
  and singing a most doleful chant. The baboo bustles about, and makes
  vacant for us two sofas, the places of honor. Little marble tables
  are before them, on which are placed wine, brandy and soda-water. The
  other guests resume their seats along the two sides of the room on
  our right and left. There are eight or ten men and two or three
  ladies; the ladies very handsomely dressed. Lower down are several
  young girls in light drapery, laughing, talking and smoking their
  hookahs. The fair sex look rather scared and shyly at the foreigners,
  but some of the men are evidently trying to reassure them. Order
  being at length restored, our cheroots lighted and our iced
  brandy-pawnee made ready, the performance recommences. The corps de
  ballet are not hired for the occasion, but form part of the
  establishment of our friend the baboo. One of the girls seated near
  the musician advances slowly, in time with the music, to within a few
  feet of one of our sofas, and she is followed by another, who places
  herself opposite the other sofa. Others in the same way prepare to
  dance before the other guests. They all stand for a moment in a
  languid and graceful attitude, the music strikes up a fresh air, and
  each nautch-girl assumes the first position of her dance. She stands
  with outstretched arm and hand, quivering them, and allowing her body
  very slightly to partake of the same movement. Her feet mark the time
  of the music, not by being raised, but by merely pressing the floor
  with the toes. The action and movement thus seem to run like a wave
  through the body, greatest where it begins in the hand, and gradually
  diminishing as it dies away in the foot. With a change of time in the
  accompaniment the girl drops her arm, advances a step or two nearer
  the person before whom she is dancing, and leans back, supporting her
  whole weight on one foot, with the other put forward, and pressing
  against the floor the border of her drapery.</p>

  <p>In her hands she holds a little scarf, <span class="pagenum">[pg
  490]</span> which serves to give a motive to the action of the arms
  and head. The movement in this figure, which admits of great variety,
  no two performers being at all alike in it, is somewhat stronger than
  in the first. The undulation, too, instead of dying away gradually
  from its commencement, runs with equal force, like the line of an S,
  through the body. Without any pause in the music the dancer sometimes
  glides imperceptibly into, sometimes begins with startling
  suddenness, the next movement. The general position remains what it
  was before, but to describe how its principle of life and motion
  seems concentrated below the dancer&#39;s waist, and from thence
  flows in undulating streams, to flash from or to dull, according to
  her organization, the eyes, and to crisp the child-like feet with
  which she grasps the carpet, is for me impossible. A Gavarni might
  draw what would recall this wonderful pantomime to the brain of one
  who had seen it, but nothing but his own imagination could suggest it
  to him who had not. One of these girls is a perfect actress:
  numberless shades of expression pass over her delicate features, but
  the prevailing one is a beseeching, supplicating look. We administer
  to her, as the custom is, some rupees in token of our admiration, and
  with an arch smile the no longer supplicating damsel passes on.</p>

  <p>A vague notion prevails that a nautch is a very naughty and
  improper exhibition. My experience is limited, but I must say that in
  the few I have seen there was nothing that a <i>sergent de mile</i>
  at Mabille could have objected to. Certainly, no one who retains a
  seat during the performance of a ballet can say a word on the
  subject. If the charge of indelicacy is to be brought against either,
  it would, I think, weigh most heavily against the latter. The Indian
  dance is voluptuous and graceful, as a dance should be; which is more
  than can be affirmed of a ballet of the French school, some of the
  attitudes of which are certainly not addressed only to the sense of
  beauty. But it was now late, and, although the festivities showed no
  signs of abatement, we bade our host adieu and returned home.</p>

  <h3><a name="danbury" id="danbury"><!-- H2 anchor --></a> NO DANBURY
  FOR ME.</h3>

  <p>Not in Danbury. No: life has too many vicissitudes in that
  Connecticut borough. It presents too kaleidoscopic an appearance to
  suit my style. Family catastrophes succeed each other at a brisker
  rate than I am used to. I shouldn&#39;t relish being a Danbury man on
  North street or South street: indeed, if you urge the thing, not even
  on East, West or any other street. I could by no manner of means hope
  to get reconciled to the accidents, you know. It is climatic, I
  suppose&#8212;an exhilarating air. I should be attempting all sorts
  of impossible feats, my sickly failures would of course get into the
  papers, and chagrin, dismay and general discomfort would be my
  earthly lot. I am not ambitious to undertake teaching the family to
  rock the cradle, fry doughnuts, do the family ironing and coax our
  stray hens into the coop, all in one motion. Nor am I impatient to
  get up in the moonlight with the idea buzzing in my brain that
  burglars have arrived, and after putting two or three pounds of lead
  into our best cow, to creep back to bed feeling badly, like a second
  Alexander, that there&#39;s no more glory. Really, I haven&#39;t
  enterprise enough for Danbury.</p>

  <p>Now, there <i>are</i> men who ought to start off at once and move
  into that town. A wide-awake, bustling fellow, who craves excitement,
  who is never happy unless whirling around like a bobbin with a
  ten-per-cent. semi-annual dividend to earn, who is on hand at all the
  dog-fights, Irish funerals, runaway teams, tenement fires,
  razor-strop matinées, and public convulsions generally,&#8212;such a
  man, if he went well recommended, would be likely to find, I imagine,
  constant employment in the town of Danbury. He might make
  arrangements to take his meals on the jump, and would sleep of course
  with his hat and boots on. Browne is mercurial. Browne would be happy
  in Danbury. Till he died. For a fortnight, say&#8212;one brief,
  glowing, ecstatic fortnight. Fourteen giddy days <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 491]</span> would surely finish him. Imagine Browne
  (him of the eagle eye) up in the morning, his face washed, hair
  combed, breakfast taken aboard, and everything trim and tight for
  sailing out into the surging whirlpool of Danbury locals. We see him
  fold the substantial Mrs. B. to his manly bosom and discharge a
  parent&#39;s duty toward the little Brownes. We see him tear himself
  from the bosom of his family. It is affecting, as those things
  usually are.</p>

  <p>Browne gains the street, backing out of his gate as he blows a
  superfluous kiss to Miss Tilly Browne, his youngest. He lurches, just
  as you may expect, into a stout market-woman laden with eggs and
  garden vegetables. She careens wildly, and plunges into a baby-cart
  that is pushing by. The darling occupant of fourteen months is
  smothered in a raw omelet and frescoed over the eye by bunches of
  asparagus. The cries of the sweet little cherub would melt the
  stoutest heart. The market-lady caracoles around, and leads Browne to
  infer that his conduct is not approved, from her festooning that
  gentleman&#39;s eyes with heavy lines of crape. Mrs. Browne arrives
  on the scene. The baby goes into fits. The fast-assembling crowd cry
  &quot;Shame!&quot; and Browne, after trying in vain to apologize,
  seeks the shelter of a hack and makes good his escape.</p>

  <p>He descends at Main street, just in time to observe the man with
  the ladder and paint-pot working his way up along. That genius is
  smashing in store fronts and dropping paint liberally on the
  population. However, as he does this twice a day regularly through
  the week, it does not appear to attract much attention, except from
  strangers.</p>

  <p>The fat gentleman who is in training to remove pieces of
  orange-peel from the sidewalk has already begun his labor of love for
  the day. He is just getting up and dusting himself as Browne goes by.
  There is nothing fresh in this either, so Browne does not stop. He
  merely nods and hurries on.</p>

  <p>That Danbury youth who gets snarled up so badly when he is sent to
  do anything, and who has lived through no end of mustard plaster and
  other soothing applications, is standing in a doorway whistling.
  Browne conceives it to be a capital idea to waylay this boy and
  interview him. But, as if divining Browne&#39;s purpose, the young
  hero gives a war-whoop and dives down a side alley. Browne will write
  up the interview just the same, though.</p>

  <p>Browne sees something lively now, something Danburian. A fire
  company in lobster-colored shirts turn into Main street, aided and
  abetted by a brass band hired by the job to play furiously. Browne
  admires the gallant firemen as they step along bravely, winking at
  the pretty girls on either side&#8212;at the machine which glistens
  in the sun, and maintains a lively jingling of bells and brass-work
  as it joggles over the pavement. &quot;Ah,&quot; thinks Browne,
  &quot;this is gorgeous!&quot; It is. Browne&#39;s instincts are
  generally correct.</p>

  <p>The man who assists in carrying the bass drum has a sore thumb, a
  sensitively sore thumb. Nothing more natural, when Sherman goes
  &quot;marching through Georgia,&quot; than that this thumb should
  come in for a share of attention. The bang it gets sends the acutest
  pain running up and down its owner&#39;s spine. In a frenzy (in a
  moment, we may say, of emotional insanity) he draws a tomahawk and
  buries it in the head of the captain of that bass drum. The
  infuriated musician, supposing it to be the cornet who has mutinied,
  at once gets his Smith &amp; Wesson in range. When the smoke has
  cleared away three shots are found to have taken effect&#8212;two of
  them in a span of high-stepping horses attached to the elegant
  turnout of old Mrs. P&#8212;&#8212;. That estimable lady is spilled
  into the third-story window of an establishment where sits our old
  friend Hannah binding shoes. The shock so far upsets poor
  Hannah&#39;s reason that she turns a blood-curdling somersault out
  upon an awning, bounces back, and on her return trip carries away a
  swinging sign and a barber&#39;s pole. These heavy articles strike on
  a copper soda-fountain, which explodes with a fearful noise, and
  mortally wounds a colored man <span class="pagenum">[pg 492]</span>
  uninsured against accident. (Full particulars for the next twelve
  months in the insurance journals.) The gallant boys in red flannel,
  assuming from the commotion that a fire must be under way in the
  neighborhood, set the machine to work in a twinkling. The leading
  hoseman in his hurry rams his bouquet into the fire-box, tries to
  screw his silver trumpet on the end of the hose, and stands on his
  stiff glazed hat to find out what kind of strategy is needed. Then
  they proceed to drown out an ice-cream saloon on the wrong side of
  the street.</p>

  <p>Browne is happy. He climbs a lamppost, and sets to work taking
  notes as fast as his pencil can fly. Somebody, mistaking his
  coat-tail pockets for the post-office, drops in a set of public
  documents (it is the last day of franking), which so interferes with
  Browne&#39;s equilibrium that he falls over backward into an
  ash-barrel, after getting out of which he finds it rests him to write
  with his pencil in his teeth. At last order is restored, the thumb is
  repaired, and the procession, getting untangled, moves off to the
  inspiriting strains of &quot;Ain&#39;t you glad,&quot; etc.</p>

  <p>Browne mixes in two more scenes before lunch. In the afternoon
  there&#39;s a balloon ascension, where everything goes up but the
  balloon; and a croquet-party brim full of eccentricities. Browne
  picks up half a dozen juvenile and domestic incidents, hardly worth
  alluding to, and goes home, through a series of adventures, to find a
  tall, raw-boned horse, a total stranger, walking over his flower-beds
  and occasionally looking in at the windows. Browne&#39;s skirmishes
  around the animal (the whole campaign together) cost him about thirty
  dollars.</p>

  <p>I resign Danbury to Browne. Though there&#39;s a capital fellow
  there whom I should like to see, I&#39;d rather not go down there and
  pay taxes.</p>

  <h3><a name="ghost" id="ghost"><!-- H2 anchor --></a> ANOTHER
  GHOST.</h3>

  <p>In the August number of this magazine a narrative is given of a
  ghostly appearance which haunted a house in a seaside town. The
  writer states that she was not an actor in its scenes, nor was it
  related to her by one who was. Having more than once heard the story
  from the lips of the principal witness of the events, Mrs.
  M&#8212;&#8212; of Newport, I can confirm the correctness of the
  narrative, in the main. Some of the particulars, however, having been
  altered in the transmission, I will give my version, to the best of
  my remembrance.</p>

  <p>When Mrs. M&#8212;&#8212; hired the house, which had been for some
  time vacant, she found it difficult to procure or keep servants. This
  in itself is not uncommon, but in this case there was something more.
  The servants complained of being disturbed at night by a woman who
  walked the chambers with a white hood upon her head&#8212;not a
  sun-bonnet, as I am glad to state, which is certainly a more
  commonplace head-dress. Some of the neighbors were also asking from
  time to time who that woman was who sat at the upper hall window in a
  white hood. It could not have been a little boy who was disturbed by
  the strange woman, for Mrs. M&#8212;&#8212; had no son, but one of
  the daughters when sitting in the upper hall on a hot evening, and
  making the remark that it was very warm, heard the reply from out of
  the darkness, &quot;I am so cold!&quot;</p>

  <p>As in Mrs. Hooper&#39;s version, the dénoûment was brought about
  by the aid of a clergyman. Men of this profession have always been
  considered the most efficient guardians against the powers of
  darkness. He, with the help of Mrs. M&#8212;&#8212;, made the
  excavation in the cellar which brought to light the half-consumed
  skeleton. Here, unfortunately, is a gap in the evidence. The remains
  were pronounced by medical authority to be human, but was that
  authority reliable? was that doctor skilled in comparative anatomy?
  If not, the bones might have been those of a sheep, buried perchance
  in the cellar by a provident dog.</p>

  <p>The house still stands, or did recently, in Washington street. The
  builder was a sea-captain returning after a long absence with plenty
  of money, supposed by the townspeople to have been <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 493]</span> acquired in the slave-trade or by piracy.
  There was also a young woman, house-keeper to this Captain Kidd, who
  disappeared about the time that he did himself.</p>

  <p>Mrs. M&#8212;&#8212; was fond of narrating this story, and, having
  a pretty talent that way, she had versified it; though I am bound to
  say that in plain prose it was much more effective. She was an
  Englishwoman, had seen much of the world, and was a person of
  considerable reading and cultivation. She had moral and physical
  courage in an uncommon degree, and was thoroughly reliable, so that
  this story is to me as well authenticated as one can well be at
  second hand.</p>

  <p>I have another incident of the same shadowy and quasi-supernatural
  kind to relate, which took place in the same street of that town,
  formerly much affected by ghosts and other supernatural appearances.
  I say formerly, for what spirit, however perturbed, could revisit the
  glimpses of the moon in a modern villa, or abide long within the
  sound of the steam-whistle?</p>

  <p>Some years ago I was living in Newport in an old-fashioned house,
  also built by a retired sea-captain in the early part of the century,
  but, unlike the other, there were no tales of terror connected with
  it that I ever heard of. At 1 p.m. on a winter&#39;s day, in the
  midst of a furious snow-storm, as we sat at dinner, we heard a
  commotion in the kitchen. Instead of the expected joint, enter a
  pallid woman: &quot;Oh, please come out and see Martha!&quot; The
  lady of the house hastened to the kitchen, and found Martha, the
  cook, almost fainting upon a chair. &quot;What is the matter?&quot;
  As soon as she could speak she gasped out, &quot;Oh, that face at the
  window!&quot; The window of the kitchen looked out upon the garden,
  which had a high fence all around it. I at once ran out to see if any
  person was there: the ground was covered with a pure and untrodden
  surface of snow six or eight inches deep. This was rather startling,
  when inside the window a woman was fainting at the sight of some
  fearful appearance on the outside. I looked out on the street, which
  ran alongside the garden fence, and which was not much of a
  thoroughfare. There were no tracks to be seen in the snow. No human
  foot had lately been in the garden.</p>

  <p>When the woman came to herself, she said that, suddenly looking
  up, she saw a female face with an agonized expression looking in at
  her from the window. On being asked if it was any one whom she knew,
  she replied that the face seemed familiar, but that she could not
  recall the name that belonged to it. After reflection she said that
  it looked like a daughter of hers whom she had not seen since she was
  a child. The girl had been brought up by a lady in another State, and
  was now a married woman, living in Vermont.</p>

  <p>About a week afterward, Martha received a letter from the lady who
  had brought up her daughter, informing her that the young woman had
  recently died after a short illness, and that her great anxiety
  seemed to be to see her mother before she died. Some time after I
  wrote to the town indicated to ascertain the exact time of the young
  woman&#39;s death. The husband had moved away immediately after the
  funeral, but the town clerk replied that a person of the name
  mentioned had died there about the time mentioned in my letter. Here
  came the fatal gap in the evidence, which always seems to prevent the
  chain being perfect. If I could have obtained a certificate of the
  death having occurred on the day of the snow-storm, I should have
  found myself nearer to a ghost than I ever expect to be again till I
  become one myself.</p>

  <h2>NOTES.</h2>

  <p>Treatises on the &quot;language of flowers&quot; should, to be
  complete, give a chapter on their political significance. England had
  her War of the Roses; and of this contest a mild travesty may
  possibly be furnished in a French &quot;Strife of the Flowers&quot;.
  The violet is the Bonapartist badge, and when, last spring, the
  emperor died in exile, and his partisans sought to show some outward
  token of their fidelity to his memory and his <span class=
  "pagenum">[pg 494]</span> cause, violets began to bloom profusely in
  buttonholes as the half disguised emblem of the outlawed party. But
  there was one unexpected result of this demonstration, for in
  republican Marseilles the flower-merchants found their trade in
  violets declining, owing to the popular distrust of this once
  favorite and unassuming flower. It is almost incredible that the
  third city of France should have so thrown down the gauntlet to one
  of the sweetest gifts of Nature. But if upon the innocent violet is
  to be heaped the curse of Sedan, then when Bourbonism lifts its
  abashed head are lilies to be proscribed in the Lyons market as
  violets were darkly suspected in Marseilles? And if the radicals
  should make the red poppy their symbol, would it in turn be scorned
  by the lovers of the lily? If so, with the numerous parties, new and
  old, in France, what flower could a Frenchman wear or cultivate
  without danger of being mobbed by the partisans of some other emblem
  in politics?</p>
  <hr class="short" />
  <p>Thousands of people who have passed the summer in the country, and
  have been accustomed to take long drives, will testify to noticing
  one great lack on the highways of our country. This lack is that of
  guide-posts. There is no more effectual way of giving a traveler a
  vivid impression of the sparsity of settlement in a rural district
  than to let him lose his way. Regions which he might otherwise have
  fancied to be densely peopled will seem to him strangely depopulated.
  In cities, where a hundred people can always be found between any two
  streets to tell you your whereabouts, we yet scrupulously post up
  signs at every corner; but in the country, where you may travel a
  mile before meeting a man or a house, hardly one in five of the
  junctions of thoroughfares are marked with guide-boards. This lack is
  perhaps more serious in the suburbs of large cities than elsewhere,
  since in thinly-settled districts the main road at least is generally
  easy to keep. Occasionally the post is a mocker, its painted letters
  being suffered to grow so dim with time as not to be decipherable; or
  perhaps the board has been carried off by a gale, or else turned the
  wrong way by some joker, who relies on the authorities to neglect the
  mischief. It would save much time and temper for wayfarers were
  guide-boards multiplied fourfold in all parts of the country.</p>
  <hr class="short" />
  <p>When Von Moltke had conquered France, his first care for the
  future was to protect Germany, by the seizure of the French frontier
  fortresses, from all danger of successful attack in time to come; yet
  at Belfort one gap in the line has been left in the keeping of
  France&#8212;possibly, like the heel of Achilles, the point at which
  a hostile shaft may one day wound the German empire. The Berlin
  <i>Börsenzeitung</i>, which claims that with Metz, Strasburg,
  Mayence, Coblentz and Cologne, and with the enlargement of Ulm and
  Ingoldstadt and the new line of Bavarian defence, &quot;Germany has a
  barrier of fortresses unequaled in the world,&quot; yet admits that
  the project of establishing a new German fortress near Mulhouse or
  Huningue, &quot;so as to take the place of Belfort,&quot; has now
  been abandoned&#8212;a fact which seems to show that there is one
  little loophole in the defensive armor of Germany, otherwise
  invulnerable.</p>
  <hr class="short" />
  <p>&quot;A man may steal the livery of Heaven to serve the devil
  in.&quot; It has always been a favorite device of Napoleonism to
  dress itself up in the garb of popular government, and to appropriate
  the peculiar phrases of democracy, with a view to confound the
  distinction between the sovereign will of one and the sovereign will
  of the many. Napoleon III. enjoyed proclaiming himself the great
  champion of universal suffrage, although what his <i>plébiscites</i>
  really were the caustic pen of Kinglake has told us. The other day
  the French imperialists celebrated at Chiselhurst the fête of the
  late emperor; and there Prince Louis had the audacity to say:
  &quot;Planting myself as an exile near the tomb of the emperor, I
  represent his teachings, which may be summarized in the motto,
  &#39;Govern for the people, by the people.&#39;&quot; The motto was a
  double plagiarism&#8212;a plagiarism <span class="pagenum">[pg
  495]</span> in idea from the republican theory, and a plagiarism in
  expression from the immortal phrase, &quot;government of the people,
  by the people, and for the people,&quot; pronounced by Lincoln at
  Gettysburg.</p>
  <hr class="short" />
  <p>The most sensible, manly and independent address made to the shah
  during his European tour was, we think, the speech of welcome
  delivered by the president of the Swiss Confederation. We may premise
  that the shah is the first sovereign who, as such, has become the
  guest of Switzerland since the meeting of the Council of Constance in
  the fifteenth century. Still, the Swiss people did not show
  themselves overcome, but received their guest with a sober and
  dignified cordiality&#8212;a sail, a dinner without speeches, and a
  magnificent illumination of Geneva and the lake providing the
  entertainment. On arriving at the railroad station the shah was
  greeted by the Swiss president in words which we render literally as
  follows: &quot;Royal Majesty: I welcome you in the name of the
  authorities of the Swiss Confederation. You do not expect to find
  here the sumptuous greeting of the great nations which surround us.
  We have to show you neither a standing army nor the splendors of a
  fleet. You come into the midst of a people that owes to liberty and
  to labor the place that it has made for itself in Europe, and it is
  in the name of this free people that the Federal Council offers you
  hospitality.&quot; The severe simplicity of this address is the more
  tasteful since its strength and manliness do not rob it of a tithe of
  its courtesy, which last quality becomes indeed all the more striking
  from the absence of that Oriental profusion of epithets and
  compliments which the shah had received at every previous step in his
  European travels.</p>

  <h2>LITERATURE OF THE DAY.</h2>

  <blockquote>
    The Intellectual Life. By Philip Gilbert Hamerton. Boston: Roberts
    Brothers.
  </blockquote>

  <p>A man of fair culture and a frequenter of cultured society pleads
  in these pages the attractions of an intellectual bias or
  life-training: he pleads to all accessible classes&#8212;to the
  curate and to the nobleman, &quot;to a country gentleman who
  regretted that his son had the tendencies of a dilettante,&quot;
  &quot;to a lady of high culture who found it difficult to associate
  with persons of her own sex,&quot; and so on. Over seventy different
  addresses are included, each in the form of a letter, which, though
  not necessarily ever posted, is really aimed at a specific person
  known to the author and distinctively spoken to. The effort is to
  reconcile culture with the world of practice and morals, and answer
  or forestall the objections of religion or utilitarianism. Mr.
  Hamerton talks with great self-possession to the highest class within
  ear-shot, and matches a late stricture of Mr. Ruskin&#39;s&#8212;that
  English noblemen exist to shoot little birds&#8212;with another on
  the influence of railways in sending back the upper ranks to a state
  of nomadic barbarism. &quot;Their life,&quot; he says, &quot;may be
  quite accurately described as a return, on a scale of unprecedented
  splendor and comfort, to the life of tribes in that stage of human
  development which is known as the period of the chase: they migrate
  from one hunting-ground to another as the diminution of the game
  impels them.&quot; He points out a curious reaction in the spirit of
  this class: formerly they loved to lard their speech with Latin and
  Greek to keep the ignorant in their places; but now, that cheap
  education has endowed the tradesman with Latin and Greek, there is a
  tendency to feel toward intellectual culture much as the barons did
  away back in the Dark Ages, and to outdazzle by mere show of costly
  pleasure the class they can no longer excel in learned polish. After
  all, the great question in recommending culture is the question of
  its effect on morals: if the effect of poetry and art is weakening to
  the moral sense, as many <span class="pagenum">[pg 496]</span> have
  claimed from Socrates to Augustine, then letters have no ethical
  reason for existence. Our author, who has a habit of continually
  turning his tapestry to see the aspect of the other side, is very
  sensible of a characteristic in people of extreme culture to allow
  Nature her most contradictory reactions. This tendency, opposed as it
  is to all our ideal conceptions of the intellectual life, is the
  merest commonplace of biography. &quot;The most exquisitely delicate
  artists in literature and painting have frequently had reactions of
  incredible coarseness. Within the Chateaubriand of <i>Atala</i> there
  existed an obscene Chateaubriand that would burst forth in talk that
  no biographer would repeat. I have heard the same thing of the
  sentimental Lamartine. We know that Turner, dreamer of enchanted
  landscapes, took the pleasures of a sailor on the spree. A friend
  said to me of one of the most exquisite living geniuses, &#39;You can
  have no conception of the coarseness of his tastes: he associates
  with the very lowest women, and enjoys their rough
  brutality.&#39;&quot; To this specious and damaging objection our
  author makes the excellent reply, that in observing whole classes we
  generally see an advance in morals go along with an advance in
  culture. The gentleman of the present day is superior to his
  forefather whom Fielding described: he is better read and better
  educated, and at the same time more sober and more chaste. The man of
  genius does not, then, by his oscillations of temperament, retard or
  misdirect the company whose course he points. It is an interesting
  question, nevertheless, what are the moral standards of our apologist
  for the intellectual life, and what degree of ethical perfection
  would satisfy him in a world of various spheres all regenerated by
  culture. There is one letter in which he undertakes to pick out the
  special virtue which most helps his ideal way of life, and here, in
  chanting the praises of disinterestedness, he takes rather a superior
  tone toward so homespun a grace as honesty: &quot;The truth is, that
  mere honesty, though a most respectable and necessary virtue, goes a
  very little way toward the forming of an effective intellectual
  character.&quot; This refinement of ethics, which leaves the humdrum
  commandments away out of sight, is doubtless very fine, but we cannot
  be sure that Mr. Hamerton has the same standard for all the different
  strata of people whom he addresses. Pretty soon we find him
  addressing a young clergyman, who appears to have apprehensions lest
  intellectual doubts may come to disturb his satisfaction in
  Bible-teaching. To this the author replies with the following odd
  encouragement: &quot;It may be observed, however, that the regular
  performance of priestly functions is in itself a great help to
  permanence in belief by connecting it closely with practical habit,
  so that the clergy do really and honestly often retain through life
  their hold on early beliefs which as laymen they might have
  lost.&quot; This hint on the efficacy of continued rowing for
  stopping a leak in the bottom, if it be really meant for
  encouragement, shows an odd principle of honor, if not of
  &quot;honesty.&quot; When it comes to the large and attractive class
  which some persons call &quot;females,&quot; Mr. Hamerton abandons
  with ready grace his moral colors, and falls at once into the easiest
  tones proper to a man of the world. &quot;You must not be didactic
  with ladies,&quot; he says; and in the capital story about the
  mother-in-law he appears to side with the polite French <i>gendre</i>
  who said to every proposition, &quot;Yes, mother dear, you are quite
  right,&quot; and to have much sympathy with the learned Scotch lawyer
  who observed that there was not whisky enough in all Scotland to make
  him frank with his wife. Mr. Hamerton, in fact, spoiled son of
  fortune that he is, cannot keep for a long time the austerity of tone
  which belongs to a deliberate apology for culture: he therefore does
  what is better in taking the desirableness of his ideal for granted,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
